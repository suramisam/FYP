The food was the best we have had in Sri Lanka and we have been here for 4 weeks. And there was so much of it! The outdoor setting is beautiful and we had a great time talking Buddhism and living...in the moment. We were served by the owners son who was brilliant at service and explaining the dishes. We walked there from Marissa and it took 70 minutes so you may want to get a tuk-tuk. It was late when we left and the owner drove us back to Marissa. Beat that! Highly recommend in the moment.

It was June. I was the only one in the class and the price was more than reasonable.

I forgot her name but the recipes she taught me...were authentic, simple and absolutely delicious. I was able to write everything down to take home with me.

The local coconut oil, drinking the water out of the coconut and then shredding the beautiful flesh to make coconut sambar and recieving a local coconut oil recipe for hair care were a couple of other highlights.

I had a nap in the tree house after I ate.

The owner was very friendly and welcoming, open to speaking about life and truth.

Thank you guys

Soft, warm bread is a great start. Served with olive oil and balsamic, or an alternative of arabistta sauce, it is pillowy soft and yummy.

Fettuccine Alfredo is rich and creamy. The Penne Siciliano is tasty with a cheese accented tomato sauce, spiked with onion and eggplant. Spaghetti Bolognese is textbook worthy with a ragout of beef and veal that is rich and flavourful.

Crispy crusted pizzas are well executed, as well. (Like so many Sri Lankan pizza places they added fried oregano, rather than fresh basil, to their Pizza Margherita). It‚Äôs ironic that the namesake dish was the least successful dish we sampled.

Besides quite noisy and as well messy (no one giving the menu, we were asked several times if we ordered, staff is not...well organized). Kottu was the worst one we ate after 15 days in while Sri Lanka where we ate kottu every dinner. 

However the sweet rotis are really tasty and big, I would recommend the place to try tho well organized). Kottu was the worst one we ate after 15 days in while Sri Lanka where we ate kottu every dinner.
