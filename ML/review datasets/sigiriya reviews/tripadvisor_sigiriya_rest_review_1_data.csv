This restaurant is just a short walk from the hotels and from the downtown area, located at the Sigiriya Tank where you can watch people taking elephant rides and daily life passing by. Friendly locals...and a number of small souvenir shops in the area (local craftsmen plying their trade).

Had veg fried rice and a chicken stir fried vegetables & noodles. Portions are huge! One dish would have been enough for two to share. As it was, we had leftovers which we took back to our hotel, put in the fridge, and ate the next day for lunch. Total was 760 rupees.

Food was freshly prepared (we could hear everything sizzling in the kitchen) and the owner/cook speaks very good English. Menu also in English. We ate on the small outdoor dining terrace and saw three wild elephants come to the ""tank"" (lake) to drink as the sun set! Views of Lion Rock were beautiful.

Make sure you take a flashlight/torch with you and be aware walking back to the hotels that there are wild elephants in the area; but, it is only a 5-7 minute walk from the two ""tourist"" hotels to this restaurant. Locals will also caution you.
