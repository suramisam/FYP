When we arrived we were the only people there, we ordered 2 X Rice and Curry and some Coconut Roti. Food took a bit longer to make but when it came...out we saw why... we had no less than 9 different dishes plus rice and roti. They were all delicious and freshly made. My husband doesn't usually like mushrooms or beetroot, but he said that the mushroom curry was one of the best dishes and the beetroot curry was very good.

The staff was really friendly and the food prepared in the moment we ordered (no premade stuff). Probably the only place we asked for ""NO SPICE"" and it actually came without spice (thanks!...haha). The place itself is very clean and looking new. They also have super happy dogs (at least 4) in the garden that they take care of - contrary to many places in Sri Lanka where dogs are shoved away in very bad ways. And don't worry, they will not bother you or enter the restaurant - they respect the boundaries very well! 
Thanks for this meal with a great vibe <3

The food on the menu looked delicious, and it was. Unfortunately, the waiters were too busy swarming around one particular table (the owner or some VIP?) to pay...attention to us, or even get our orders right. We waited for half an hour for our food, while the people at the other table, who came after us, got theirs before.  Loved the food, though. The experience would have been great with some decent servi attention to us, or even get our orders right.

We were welcomed right away with a warm greeting and seated...right away. I ordered the Tuna Sandwich (my go-to) and my wife got the Veggie Omelette with a fruit plate. Everything was so fresh and delicious, especially the fruit! Even the Sri Lanka coffee was some of the best.
