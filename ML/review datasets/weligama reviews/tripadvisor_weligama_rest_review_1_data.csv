I have been here twice and it did not disappoint. Chef makes an effort to socialize with you. You can honestly taste his passion for cooking through his food.

It amazes me how chef...prepares everything himself. From papadam to coconut milk and the sun-dried spices to potato chips. You can also buy the spices in a package which contains 21 ingredient.

I have also taken the cooking class from chef. This is not a standard offer but you could ask chef, if you are interested. I appreciated how he showed me how he prepares everything from scratch. People who just arrived in Sri Lanka do not have to be afraid of bad food here: everything is prepared when you order. The ingredients are fresh for sure!

I have enjoyed every bit of food. I would recommend getting: 

- Rice and (chicken/vegetable) 
curry
- Eggplant with tomato and onions 
- Salad
- Dahl with papadams 
- Potato chips with salt and pepper 
- Prawns with spinach and tomato sauce 
- Pancake with banana and vanilla ice cream

I have been here twice and it did not disappoint. Chef makes an effort to socialize with you. You can honestly taste his passion for cooking through his food.

It amazes me how chef...prepares everything himself. From papadam to coconut milk and the sun-dried spices to potato chips. You can also buy the spices in a package which contains 21 ingredient.

I have also taken the cooking class from chef. This is not a standard offer but you could ask chef, if you are interested. I appreciated how he showed me how he prepares everything from scratch. People who just arrived in Sri Lanka do not have to be afraid of bad food here: everything is prepared when you order. The ingredients are fresh for sure!

I have enjoyed every bit of food. I would recommend getting: 

- Rice and (chicken/vegetable)

- Eggplant with tomato and onions

- Dahl with papadams 
- Potato chips with salt and pepper 
- Prawns with spinach and tomato sauce

Sincerely, try whatever pizza that you like, the dough on which the pizza is put on, is amazing on its own and you won't be disappointed. 
I strongly recommend to make a reservation...in advance, as the place is usually totally full and it's hard to find a free table if you just decide to pop in random in advance, as the place is usually totally full and it's hard to find a free table if you just decide to pop in randomly."

We ordered prawns with fries and salad then. They brought a portion with 7 (!!) small prawns and some salad. No fries available, they said -...ok, but the price for the food was still full. Only after a conflict they gave us a discount for the chips that we didn’t receive. And anyway the price was toooo big for a really TINY portion of salad and 7 small prawns. 

I was really disappointed. We went to another restaurant across the street and had a proper dinn ok, but the price for the food was still full.
