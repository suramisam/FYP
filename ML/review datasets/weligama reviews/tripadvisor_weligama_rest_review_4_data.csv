The ambience and location are great.  Go for a drink, but eat somewhere else!

Here's why I only give it one star:

We ordered the Isso and the Epic tropica bowl. When it arrived I realized that the Epic...Tropica was missing 4 ingredients (avocado, red cabbage, cahshew nuts and mint) out of about 9 ingredients. So just under half. The avocado was missing from the Isso.

I reported this to the waiter straight away. He said that the items were unfortunately no longer in stock in the kitchen. I then asked him if he thought it was okay that I should pay the full price for half of the items listed. He said he would report it to the manager. Nothing happened.

As I was there with my partner and didn't want to ruin the evening, I ate the bowl. When I paid, I was charged the full price. I pointed out to them again that half of my bowl was missing. They smiled at me and said they would report it to the manager. Again, nothing...

Ordered a burger which had a smell and rice bowl where rice was ice cold straight out of a fridge. Serving sizes were tiny for the price - the rice bowl had small chicken pieces which were single digit.

There...are many other better places you can go to for half the price. Not sure why anyone would rate this place so high are many other better places you can go to for half the price. Not sure why anyone would rate this place so highly."

The staff said it was 'off season' so hence quiet. We sat on the roof eating area, which was nicely set up. I'm sure the view is...lovely during the day. 

I have to say, the service given by the single member of staff was excellent! We ordered a Chicken Teriyaki and 2 burgers, along with drinks. 

The burgers were delicious and I cant remember the last time I had such a good one! I will definitely come back for another whenever next in Weligama. 

The rest of the food was good and well presented. The music was great and we really enjoyed sitting out and enjoying the wonderful breeze to keep us cool.

I was a little worried with the solo staff and no one else eating - but it was all done very well. Food was clean, well presented and tasty. 

I'm told the proprietor is from Sweden - so If you're reading this, your staff is doing a good j lovely during the day.

The menu is not huge, but you’ll find nice options for any meal of the day. I ate there every day of my trip ;) Their cocktails are great too. I also liked iced americano.  It’s a...local Sri Lankan coffee.

The food was incredible - so fresh. My favs were the sushi rice bowl, the BBB burger and corn fritters for brekky. 

The cocktails were so yum and...happy hour was 2 for 1! Thai Basil with the coconut milk is a must try. 

Can’t wait to come back next trip to Sri Lan happy hour was 2 for 1! Thai Basil with the coconut milk is a must try.

Would not go again, i think there are better choices in town, price to quality just...doesn't make se doesn't make sense"

Chocolate chip cookies are great. I liked French Toast, but Eggs Benedict were far too runny, the egg white was completely uncooked. Very nice staff."

You have a date and you want to go for a drink? Perfect! But for a good dinner you can’t come here. Deep fried burgers, potatoes etc. Not one local dish on the menu. So I was pretty disappointed....On top the potatoes were completely salty.

We paid LKR 11k for a simple 2 pax lunch (drink and burger), which is almost similar to an all-in buffet at a luxurious hotel such as Marriott.More"
