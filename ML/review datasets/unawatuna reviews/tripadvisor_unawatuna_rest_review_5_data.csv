Walking past, you immediately get enticed by the vibrant atmosphere. Once inside, the experience gets even better! 

We were seriously impressed by the contemporary menu + innovative cocktails on offer. You can...tell a lot of thought has gone into the dishes, which are super fresh & extremely delicious.

The team are also superb & obviously really enjoy working in such a great venue. 

Special thanks to Coco for making our experience so speci tell a lot of thought has gone into the dishes, which are super fresh & extremely delicious.

Why didn't I go before????  What a great experience.  A lot about Koha really works for the Unawatuna vibe - first  is that it is a ""Surf Lounge""!  The spacious layout is great and there is...a mixture of seating - day beds, tables or at the bar.  The menu is not extensive but does not need to be when it has attractive items... I had the Crispy Chicken Burger with Sweet potato chips then Mango and Coconut rice for desert.  Hanna and her husband who own Koha (I will get his name soon) were perfect hosts, she made us feel very welcome - when we were arrived there was limited seating but she offered us another table when one became available although we decided to stay where we were.  The Peanut Cup was a kind gesture at the end of the meal!  Oh yes, prices are good and service by the team was excellent although it was quite busy.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRYING KOHA SURF LOUNGE for lunch or dinner.   See you again so a mixture of seating - day beds, tables or at the bar.

Very chill spot with nice music. The only thing that brought down the rating was the heat! The place needs more air con/fans. We were very uncomfortable which made it difficult to enjoy the amazing food.More
