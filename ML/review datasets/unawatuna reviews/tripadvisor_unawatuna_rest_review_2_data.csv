This is some of the best grilled seafood I have ever had. The butter garlic relish that they grill the fish in, was incredible. 

So extremely good :)

We tried the Tom Yum soup, Seafood...Sizzle Platter, Sri Lankan Prawn Curry, Crab Curry and Fried Prawns . Can’t say which one was better as it was all super delicious.

Another highlight of the place is the service, from the moment we enter Uvinda took a very good care of us. He was very humble and professional, explained the menu well and suggested the best dishes. Job well done Uvinda.

New Year’s Eve we had the sizzling mixed seafood crab.  2 lobsters. Giant king prawns, calamari and a very large red snapper accompanied by rice, chips...and salad it was fantastic.
Cocktails are some of the best we had also they have a team behind the bar so unlike other places drinks arrive very quick .
The restaurant is busy every night so fish is fresh every day.
The owners and staff are lovely but still very professional 
I must make special mention about the young waiter that kept the table clean and ran after us when I left my bag on my chair to find us he was a star.
Hope to return next year and we are considering stopping in there accommodation the food was that goo and salad it was fantastic.
