There was a fantastic range of pizzas, pastas and appetisers. While the pricing was more expensive than the usual dining in Sri Lanka, the pizza size made up for it. As a couple, I would recommend either only having 2 pizzas (no starters) or having one pizza to share and have starters!

They refused to join tables for our seating while others received it freely. Orders were considerably delayed. My daughter ordered a dish with some Avocado and 5 mins later when we wanted to order an extra serving of Avocado (with us paying for it) owner suddenly said all Avocados are finished as they have made Guacamole from all of it!!........It is scarcely beleiveable that in 5 mins flat all Avocados were finished.....in fact we even saw avocados being served with other dishes even an hour after our request was turrned down. This is just some of the bad experiences we had.

When we went to give some calm and honest feedback the owner started accusing us and said she has always has a problem with ""certain kind of people"" and has been more than ""generous"". Other hotel staff also came and started shouting.

This kind of racist behaviour lacking in basic human courtesy and going against every tenet of hospitality is very much not acceptable, specially in today's day and age.

Would advise all South Asians to stay away from a racist establishment like this.

Hope the owner can sleep well at night knowing she runs such a racist establishme all refused seating and when we pointed out empty tables they finally agreed but gave us a 7 seater table.

We went for taco Tuesday...and tried 6 different tacos. They were so good we ended up going back 2 more times before our trip ended. The margaritas are wonderful, they have several to choose from. We also tried the guacamole and some nachos. All food gets a 10!
