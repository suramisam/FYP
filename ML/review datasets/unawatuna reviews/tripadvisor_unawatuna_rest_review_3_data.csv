Pizzas on sourdough bases are really good although the thin based pizzas are also excellent.
Very reasonably priced."

I had the Diavoni (salami and hot honey) and itâ€™s the best pizza Iâ€™ve had in years. Sourdough base too. 

Itâ€™s pricey at 5,060 including service charge of 10% but worth it. Could have served...2 people but I was super hung 2 people but I was super hungry."

We had a sourdough pizza each and they were lovely. The atmosphere was great and the staff were really helpful. We really fancied something western and this hit the spot.

Very crispy and cheesy aranchini with beautiful pesto. The wood fire pizza was so good where to the extent my not eating pizza husband devored 3/4 of it. As for the cheese and spinach ravioli it was yumm. A date night...must for a night out and a change from local cuisi must for a night out and a change from local cuisine.

They had recognised us from the morning visit. We wanted to check it was open due to it being the full moon festival...and it being the off-season.

There was a fantastic range of pizzas, pastas and appetisers. While the pricing was more expensive than the usual dining in Sri Lanka, the pizza size made up for it. As a couple, I would recommend either only having 2 pizzas (no starters) or having one pizza to share and have starters! 

Very good experience. Thank y and it being the off-season.

If you are pizza lover this is a must place to have a bite and very good option when youâ€™ve had enough curry and kottu and need a change.

Pizzas were good and the chicken on the salad was good too, but dressing was tasteless and croutons were soft. 
But the worst was that the first pizza...only arrived after the girls had finished eating the salads ... and the second pizza only came after my son had eaten his pizza. 
Considering the price, it was not good enou only arrived after the girls had finished eating the salads ... and the second pizza only came after my son had eaten his pizza. 
Considering the price, it was not good enough."

Great pizzas as well as a small selection of fresh pasta dishes and entrÃ©es like bruschetta and arancini.

The pizzas live up to their reputation, super tasty, the dough is special, very airy a real treat, it's the only place where I eat the whole pizza with the...crusts!
I also recommend their ravioli, especially the spinach-ricotta ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤.
It's a bit more expensive than elsewhere but considering the quality of the ingredients and the portions, it's totally worth the pri crusts!
