We walked into Love Gelato and the owner welcomed us with a smile and warmth. He talked us through the flavours on offer and how...these are made with no chemicals and locally sourced produce. Myself, my husband and 3 kids all made our choices and I can say this has to be the best ice- cream I have ever tasted. It was creamy the consistency was perfect and the taste of each flavour was sensational. We chose Mango, lime and basil and Stracciatella and all were divine.

The ice cream is delicious and well worth the money. You can see that the owner uses good and natural products, and approaches his business with love (it tastes like...ice cream in Rome, or Florence. ).

After trying to find out where they were coming from, we found ourselves at this location!

An excellent selection of gelatos with freshly baked waffles. 

You must try their passion fruit...& papaya gelatos! They were out of this world.

For 2 euros I got very small portion and the salted caramel one was one of the worst I have ever had.
I do not want to say that...it is completely terrible but the value for money is extremely bad.
