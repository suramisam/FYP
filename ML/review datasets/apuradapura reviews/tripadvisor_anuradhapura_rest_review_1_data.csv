We ordered half a tandoori chicken, paneer Makhani, chapati, lemon soda (served with sugar syrup) and a mango lassi 

The food was really really good. The tandoori chicken was cooked to perfection with amazing flavours, it also packed a nice kick of heat.

Forget doing that here as half the items are not even in stock. Furthermore, there is no lunch menu so you have to try and order from...the normal menu to then only be told that they don't serve xyz items at lunch.

I asked them to make the chana masala dish not spicy at all - he ignored my request and just made it how it's normally made. Nothing was done to rectify the situation - this institution seems to believe that it will indefinitely retain its place at the higher end of the market due to its reviews. 

Please avoid this place. There are plenty of other good eateries in Anuradhapu the normal menu to then only be told that they don't serve xyz items at lunch.
