The food was inedible in any way. The taste was disgusting and the looks of the dishes even more so, it looked and tasted as if the food had gone...bad.
The fried rice was burnt. The chicken cop suey was so bad it felt dangerous. We asked to change the dishes and they said it was fine.
When we got to pay they charged us for the food we could not eat from and did not touch. When we tried to talk to them they were so disrespectful and rude.
They ONLY care about the money. They don’t care about you. 
There are so many amazing places to eat in Ella!! Don’t waste your precious time and money the bad.
