Fortunately, and even if as a Portuguese soul and citizen I think I am, our ""Taprobana"" or ""Ceilão"", things here are even more astonishing than...one may believe... The small pace and a smile: Galle, Mirissa, Kandy, Udawalawe National Park, Ella... and The Barn by Starbeans. You may ask: ""Where the heck is this 'The Barn by Starbeans'?"" Well, it is not a mountain, since it lies in a small valley. Nor an Ayurvedic spot. Let alone a wild elephant reserve. In fact, The Barn by Starbeans is a bar & restaurant right in the middle of Ella, a small yet buzzy small town right in the Center-South of Sri Lanka. I would take the risk — and the ""stiff competition"" around is also worth credit, actually, I guess they are all symbiotic — to say this is a one-stop-shop. Live music, great (Lion) beer, brilliant ambience, good wine list, outstanding interior design, fast Wi-Fi, open kitchen, huge portions, very decent prices, some of the friendliest staff I've ever seen in my life (just ask for Agi, for instance, he will tell you all the small tricks to maximizing your experience)... Not enough, this spot has Vidu as manager as a maestro. Just ask for him. Well, Vidu is not just the manager of The Barn by Starbeans. He also manages to be ubiquitous (or, as Depeche Mode would put it, a ""Personal Jesus"", way better than a personal trainer). Do you need something? Vidu comes to your table. Do you want to know further about Sri Lanka's History, Geography, and Local/National idiosyncrasies? Vidu comes to your table. Three eyes at least. As a former travel writer, these kinds of rare places impress me and always deserve to be properly credited. Hospitality is the word. However, to be honest, I would extend this feeling to most Sri Lankans, not just Vidu. At the same time, this country is working for me as a mirror effect. Yes, I am sad in my home country (Portugal) this breed of generosity is disappearing fast due to several factors. Greed vs. Generosity. Honesty vs. the Mass market. Chillness vs. Stressing queues... In our national epic poem ""Lusíadas"", a true masterpiece written by Luís Vaz de Camões in the second half of the the16th century praising the Portuguese seafarer, ""discoveries"" and ventures in the East of Asia, its initial verse states: ""As armas e os barões assinalados/ Que da ocidental praia Lusitana/ Por mares nunca de antes navegados/ Passaram ainda além da Taprobana/ Em perigos e guerras esforçados/ Mais do que prometia a força humana/ E entre gente remota edificaram Novo Reino, que tanto sublimaram.""
