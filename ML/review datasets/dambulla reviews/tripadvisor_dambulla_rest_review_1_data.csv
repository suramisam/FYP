The restaurant is located in a house with...tables inside but no garden or any outdoor seating.  I had read about the yummy food on offer so was very disappointed when the various dishes arrived- a selection of local Sri Lankan dishes including two very spicy dishes which I didn't try but my partner did- they really were spicy.  Some of the other dishes were okay- the dhal was quite good but some of the other dishes were quite tasteless and the signature spinach dish was dry and almost inedible.  The dessert was curd and treacle which was good and a nice way to finish off the meal.

So, all in all, a very disappointing meal at Saman's.  It was definitely the worst meal that we have had in our 4 visits to Sri Lanka so the owner might consider putting more effort into preparing dishes that appeal to international tastes and and also into redecorating his restaurant which was downright depressing.  There were bits of artwork on the walls but obviously years old and very dusty and dirty.  There is no excuse for such a depressing environment.   Sri Lanka has such wonderful handicrafts, artwork and decor articles it would not be difficult for Saman's to spruce up their restaurant and make it  a space that people want to vis tables inside but no garden or any outdoor seating.

When we arrived we were greeted by a member of staff at the reception desk. She asked what we were there for and we said that we wanted to eat at the restaurant. She asked us to wait while she dealt...with a queue of people. Then finally we were shown where the restaurant was. No idea why she couldn't have just pointed us in the right direction  instead of making us wait for 10 minutes. It wasn't as if it was difficult to find...
But never mind, let's sit down, relax and enjoy some good quality food....
We noticed that everything was a bit overgrown and it felt as if the overall maintenance had just slipped a bit. Shame, but not the end of the world... 
We ordered food and drink. We waited. We waited a little while longer. Then after about 25 minutes I had to wander around looking for a member of staff to ask for our drink (a simple bottle of water). I was then handed a bottle as if it was the first time I had asked for it. No glasses, no apology. Very strange. But ok... Let's wait for the food.... 
Eventually the food arrived. What a disappointing experience that was... The vegetarian burger was the smallest burger we have EVER seen!!! We actually thought it was a joke or something.... Its absolutely tiny!!!! The chef didn't even attempt to make the plate look fuller with garnishing, salad or anything. Just a very sparse amount of chips that literally tasted like they had been rolled in a bath of pure salt. They tasted disgusting. The burger bun was also so stale and hard you could have used it to bang nails into a piece of wood. We had to leave it in fear of cracking a tooth!
Ok lets try the Vegetable Chopsuey that we ordered... Again, very disappointing... The sauce was bland, a very poor selection of about 3 different vegetables and the worst rice I've ever seen served up in Sri Lanka!!! Surely the chef can't be Sri Lankan serving up overcooked horrible rice like that? I'm not actually sure how you could mess up rice quite so badly...
Finally we looked at the third dish, a cheese and tomato sandwich. How could you possibly go wrong? Well, I'm afraid to say that the chips it came with were again so covered in salt they were virtually inedible. The sandwich itself was very basic. Not terrible. But just basic bread with low quality cheese and a bit of tomato thrown in.
So all in all our lunchtime visit was not a good one. Shame as the reviews had given us high hopes and we were looking forward to some nice food.
Oh, I nearly forgot.... After our food arrived we had to again get up and search for someone to ask for knives and forks. We asked 2 different people and it took about 5 minutes for them to come to our table. The whole time our food was sitting there getting cold... When they did finally arrive the cutlery was dirty!!! Greasy finger prints all over them!!!
Now some of these issues could possibly be overlooked if it was a busy day and the staff were over worked. But we were THE ONLY people there!!!! So how does a restaurant manage to mess things up this badly when there are more staff than customers???
We left feeling ripped off, mouths still dry from the crazy amount of salt on the chips and a huge feeling of disappointment.... I don't think we will be going back anytime soon. with a queue of people. Then finally we were shown where the restaurant was.

We ate here twice on a two night stay in Dambulla as they offer a welcome alternative to the typical Sri Lanka buffet...restaurant. It looks like a cafeteria yet is full of locals so we knew we were in the right place.
There is a restaurant upstairs which looks on the expensive side yet it's not. You can order what is from the more local menu downstairs and more. On our first night  we had prawn kadai and chicken masala with soft drinks. Both were excellent and finished off with a dessert downstairs. The bill came to less than 2000SLR (¬£5). We honestly couldn't believe the price. 
The next night we tried and tried to find somewhere with more of a restaurant vibe, however after looking endlessly on TripAdvisor, Google, etc there was no where that took our fancy. Dambulla is not the place for a foodie.
The second night we had a mixture of curry, naan, samosas, rotti, biryani and Mongolian stew. It was all fantastic and we sat downstairs. It's nothing fancy but the food outweighs everything. This meal with two ginger beers cost 2600SLR (¬£6.5 restaurant. It looks like a cafeteria yet is full of locals so we knew we were in the right place.

The prawn biryani my husband ordered was also not overwhelming in flavour especially since the prawns were more shrimp in size, and not flavoursome, but merely an additional afterthought to the biryani rice.
Admittedly we visited at an awkward time so the restaurant had no ambience.
