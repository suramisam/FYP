Its open by 7 a.m., so if you time it well, there is no better place for a sumptuous...and gratifying-in-everyway breakfast than Hela Bojun in and around Dambulla. There are two in the vicinity of Dambulla. But this place is unique as you can sit out under a summer hut. There is only Vegetarian Sri Lankan, so don't expect a breakfast with Scramble eggs and sausages. Who would want that anyway once you have tasted this array of authentic Sri Lankan breakfast. and gratifying-in-everyway breakfast than Hela Bojun in and around Dambulla.

The food was absolutely delicious and prepared right in front of you - hoppers, dosas, amazing (and HOT) jackfruit balls, many fried dough foods, both sweet and savoury - vadai were incredibly tasty but obviously not healthy as it’s a grease-and-carbs fest :) All dishes are vegetarian. And the price is ridiculously low compared to any other place we’ve tried. 

The only drink they had on offer was homemade soymilk.

Even though the kitchen is clean (again - you watch every meal being prepared right in front of you), I was a bit nervous because the tables and chairs in the garden are not really cleaned, they don’t have cutlery so you have to eat with your hands (not sure if it’s always like that, our driver asked for spoons and they had none so you might want to take one with you) and the place where you can wash your hands outside the restaurant has only cold water and a small piece of ordinary soap (not liquid soap).

We ate here twice on a two night stay in Dambulla as they offer a welcome alternative to the typical Sri Lanka buffet...restaurant. It looks like a cafeteria yet is full of locals so we knew we were in the right place.
There is a restaurant upstairs which looks on the expensive side yet it's not. You can order what is from the more local menu downstairs and more. On our first night  we had prawn kadai and chicken masala with soft drinks. Both were excellent and finished off with a dessert downstairs. The bill came to less than 2000SLR (£5). We honestly couldn't believe the price. 
The next night we tried and tried to find somewhere with more of a restaurant vibe, however after looking endlessly on TripAdvisor, Google, etc there was no where that took our fancy. Dambulla is not the place for a foodie.
The second night we had a mixture of curry, naan, samosas, rotti, biryani and Mongolian stew. It was all fantastic and we sat downstairs. It's nothing fancy but the food outweighs everything. This meal with two ginger beers cost 2600SLR (£6.5 restaurant. It looks like a cafeteria yet is full of locals so we knew we were in the right place.

I enjoyed the chicken kottu but was not overwhelmed by it, especially since the few pieces of chicken in the kottu were very dry and over...cooked.
The prawn biryani my husband ordered was also not overwhelming in flavour especially since the prawns were more shrimp in size, and not flavoursome, but merely an additional afterthought to the biryani rice.
Admittedly we visited at an awkward time so the restaurant had no ambience.
But at least I got to try my first kottu in Dambul cooked.
