In short nothing that we wanted to order could be served unless we were willing to wait 45-60 mins! The only option that...was available immediately was Hyderabad biryani (we all live in Hyderabad and 75% of our group was Hyderabadi - hold onto that thought). We reluctantly ordered after waiting at least 30 mins to place an order. When the food arrived, after about 20 mins, we all agreed it disgusting and resembled nothing like any biryani any of us had seen or eaten before. It was a badly fried chicken thigh with rice that had the most awful bitter taste - completely inedible! This place is a massive tourist trap which clearly caters to tourists on package deals around the heritage city.

On our way from Jaffna we were searching for place to have lunch and finally found a place on Trip Advisor called Sandra's Guest House & Restaurant. On contacting them they were extremely pleased...and advised that they have a buffet and they are able to accommodate what ever we want for lunch. 

On reaching Sandra's Guest House & Restaurant we were eagerly welcomed by Mr. Krishantha Madumal Hulangamuwa, the husband of Sandra and were extremely surprised to see such a clean, cosy setup in a natural and comfortable environment.  Krishan and his team were welcoming, accommodating, and courteous.

We were taken up with a generous spread of the buffet which included White Rice, Fried Rice, Brinjal Moju, Corn Curry, Okra Curry, Pumpkin Curry, Bean Curry, Chopsuey, Boiled Manioc , Devilled Chicken, Fried  River Fish,  Asamodagam  Mallum, Polos Pickle, Papadam, Fried Chillies and Chill Paste. 

The food was extremely delicious as it was home cooked. On questioning who cooked the food, Krishan informed us that it was his loving Mother. The food was so delicious that we ate to our hearts content. We also realised that they had gone out of their way to satisfy us and on calling for the bill we paid over and above the amount that was reflected in in the bill in appreciation of their effort.

We happened to pass by this restaurant and gave it a try. It‚Äôs a simple place with coconut hut, simple chairs and tables. The menu has a good selection of choices,...but I recommend it‚Äôs best to order rice and curry and nothing else.

There were 2 other tables eating at the restaurant, and I think they came with their drivers or tour guide. They were not local people, so the food served was not spicy. Since I like spicy food, I had to ask them to make it like the local taste.

We came here during lunch, the place was bright but I‚Äôm not sure if I would want to come here for dinner as it might be quite dark and chances are there would be plenty of mosquitos due to open air restaura but I recommend it‚Äôs best to order rice and curry and nothing else.

On our way from Jaffna we were searching for place to have lunch and finally found a place on Trip Advisor called Sandra's Guest House & Restaurant. On contacting them they were extremely pleased...and advised that they have a buffet and they are able to accommodate what ever we want for lunch. 

On reaching Sandra's Guest House & Restaurant we were eagerly welcomed by Mr. Krishantha Madumal Hulangamuwa, the husband of Sandra and were extremely surprised to see such a clean, cosy setup in a natural and comfortable environment.  Krishan and his team were welcoming, accommodating, and courteous.

We were taken up with a generous spread of the buffet which included White Rice, Fried Rice, Brinjal Moju, Corn Curry, Okra Curry, Pumpkin Curry, Bean Curry, Chopsuey, Boiled Manioc , Devilled Chicken, Fried  River Fish,  Asamodagam  Mallum, Polos Pickle, Papadam, Fried Chillies and Chill Paste. 

The food was extremely delicious as it was home cooked. On questioning who cooked the food, Krishan informed us that it was his loving Mother. The food was so delicious that we ate to our hearts content. We also realised that they had gone out of their way to satisfy us and on calling for the bill we paid over and above the amount that was reflected in in the bill in appreciation of their effort.
