You need to go to the second floor, the shop on the pictures is not a part of the actual restaurant. 
The restaurant is nice, calm, pretty and has a good atmosphere. 
The food was really great and the service was good."

We ate here twice on a two night stay in Dambulla as they offer a welcome alternative to the typical Sri Lanka buffet...restaurant. It looks like a cafeteria yet is full of locals so we knew we were in the right place.
There is a restaurant upstairs which looks on the expensive side yet it's not. You can order what is from the more local menu downstairs and more. On our first night  we had prawn kadai and chicken masala with soft drinks. Both were excellent and finished off with a dessert downstairs. The bill came to less than 2000SLR (£5). We honestly couldn't believe the price. 
The next night we tried and tried to find somewhere with more of a restaurant vibe, however after looking endlessly on TripAdvisor, Google, etc there was no where that took our fancy. Dambulla is not the place for a foodie.
The second night we had a mixture of curry, naan, samosas, rotti, biryani and Mongolian stew. It was all fantastic and we sat downstairs. It's nothing fancy but the food outweighs everything. This meal with two ginger beers cost 2600SLR (£6.5 restaurant. It looks like a cafeteria yet is full of locals so we knew we were in the right place.

Great for children. Reasonably priced, with a fun bakery downstairs too. Lucky, as it was one of the few places that was open on our visit."

I enjoyed the chicken kottu but was not overwhelmed by it, especially since the few pieces of chicken in the kottu were very dry and over...cooked.
The prawn biryani my husband ordered was also not overwhelming in flavour especially since the prawns were more shrimp in size, and not flavoursome, but merely an additional afterthought to the biryani rice.
Admittedly we visited at an awkward time so the restaurant had no ambience.
But at least I got to try my first kottu in Dambul cooked.

The baked goods selection, however, was nice - good variety of savoury and sweet stuff. Most things we tried...were of good quali were of good quality."

It was a bit hectic but it was good chance to experience a little bit of local atmosphere.
Price was reasonable and portion of food was big. 
I had kottu and...then had milk tea as people seemed to have milk tea a lot.
I recommended you have milk tea without sugar or at least ask them to put just little bit of sugar.
저녁식사를 위해 1층 식당에 방문했습니다. 시끄럽고 정신없긴 했지만, 현지 분위기를 느낄 수 있는 좋은 기회였습니다. 가격도 저렴하며 양도 많습니다. 
현지인들이 밀크티를 많이 마시는 것을 보고 식사 후에 밀크티를 마셨는데, 설탕을 빼달라고 하거나 적게 넣어달라고 요청하시는 것이 좋을 것 같습니다. 밀크티를 좋아하는데도 너무 달아서 몇 모금 밖에 마시지 못했습 then had milk tea as people seemed to have milk tea a lot.

It was okay and definitely great value for money since the portions were big. BUT: I had way better food in Sri Lanka. Besides the dining room the bakery is a must-go....We ordered three different kinds of products and all were genuinely great :) dining room: 2 stars. Bakery: 5 stars.
