The service was a little lack lustre. We had to ask for the menu twice. The food was average. We ordered a Sri Lankan curry which came with poppadom shards and rice. The curry was served in a small...bowl and was ordered medium strength. It certainly wasn’t as tasty as other local restaurants.

Upon arrival we were sat down initially at one of the plenty of available tables. I explained we had reserved and were then...moved to another table that was larger. Fine so far.

The moment I knew something was off was when out of only 4 tables occupied including ours, the largest group (of eight) was complaining about their lack of popadoms. They had nothing else yet. We waited and received our menus and began to make our selections. We had decided also to have some popadoms and one pasta and one curry. When the waiter came to take our selections we were told the particular pasta was unavailable, but the other ones were. One switch made, not great but no fuss made.

We then waited for over 1 hour. We had already finished our drinks and the table across from us had long received their main courses, though slowly delivered, and were almost finished. We had not even received our popadoms which wouldn’t haven taken even a few minutes to prepare. The staff seemed to be very busy walking around and not doing very much other than talking to the other guests. I had enough and complained we had nothing and were very hungry.

The popadoms came out, but it wasn’t over. The main courses just didn’t appear and the staff were now standing around checking phones or chatting. This time I walked into the restaurant and made clear the meals needed to be served. After this one dish came and was then nearly finished before the next dish arrived.

The food was just Ok, but not worth the long wait. The dishes of pasta and a curry should not be complicated to prepare. The curry wasn’t at all spicy as requested but there were good flavours from the ingredients like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and curry leaves. It lacked quantity and the rice portion was too small. After the main courses, we could have eaten a dessert but decided to end the meal as it had already taken too long and it was now late.

There are plenty of well run restaurants in Bentota but sadly this is not one of them.

It was a watery mixture of lumps of cinnamon stick, lemon grass and in shell crab with undercooked rice. As we weren’t provided with anything to tackle the crab with, I cracked it and gnawed on it with my teeth, but after 20 minutes of broken shell, aching jaws and rancidly sticky fingers I had to submit.
