The food is delicious, well cooked and of high quality.  My home style chicken curry was as close to my favourite Madras as I've had in this country. My husband's chicken tikka masala was full of flavour and delicious.

It was similar to a very bland korma as you may order in the UK if you don't like any heat or spice.

Firstly, just one other table was occupied but the waitress still managed to get my single-dish main course order wrong. She asked (as is usual) if I wanted it ""spicy""...(a local euphemism for hot, ie with chillies). I said ""no"", just a little bit. However, my food ordered as seafood chop suey turned up as mixed meat chop suey. Additionally, not only was it not hot, it was utterly bland, as though the ingredients had just been boiled in a saucepan. After eating a small portion and being sure of the error (some smaller restaurants add meat to seafood dishes), I brought it to the waitress's attention. She called over a senior waiter, who offered to replace it and I requested just a small portion. Though the seafood was fresh, the dish was still entirely bland. As this was a Poya Day (no alcohol served) I also ordered a vanilla milkshake for which I was charged 1500 rps! It was barely sweet, thin like skim milk and nearly flavourless and flat. When I went to pay my bill I mentioned my disappointment to the wait staff and the young woman who made the initial error smirked at me and walked away. To his credit the older waiter apologised.

This is a nice place for food, although a little more expensive than many other comparable places in Bentota.  On the other hand, some items are reasonable...value for many – for example, we enjoyed the set menu of vegetable Sri Lankan curry for (if I remember correctly) 990 rupees (or 1700 rupees for two people).

But – in my opinion – the main strength of Randholee is the great Italian-style coffee, including excellent espresso.  I ended up visiting the place every day for double espresso – at 550 rupees (plus optional tip) it is more expensive than in many places in Europe, but it is worth it, and – to be honest – there is no alternative in Bentota, as far as I can see (but I haven't tried the various resorts).  There is also a nice selection of teas and coffees in general, but I haven't explored it so far – maybe next time.  It's a great place to sit for an hour or two, read a book or work on your laptop.

The place is a little bit hidden and has two big resorts/hotels in its neighbourhood what probably makes it a bit hard to get customers. I think thats why they try to acquire guests at the beach. But there is no need to be suspicious. We had a great evening with good food for a good price.

There was a fly in one of our ordered food. When we were complaining about the same and ask manager to show up the waiter ask a tuk driver to come visit and threat us.
Waited for more than one hour to get us this terrible food and waiter ended up saying they WON’T ACCOMMODATE ANY LOCALS OR INDIANS ever to their restaurant and surprisingly that was the solution they had for the spoiled terrible food which we paid thousands on.

The chilli prawns were perfectly plump and popped in your mouth, bursting with the most deliciously spiced flavours. We were a bit disappointed not to have the Sri Lankan-style lobster which they didn’t have for the day, but the substitute of cuttle fish in traditional spices (and my request for freshly chopped chilli) was just as amazing an alternative. 
In addition, we were presented with a complimentary fresh mixed garden salad as a starter, and ended with a complimentary most delectable homemade cashew and honey ice cream!
Our young waiter was Prince Charming himself, who served us most attentively, presenting our table initially with pretty pink mangrove flowers that literally open up in front of your eyes whilst dining, and ending my romantic evening with a bunch of same said flowers to take home.

It certainly wasn’t as tasty as other local restaurants. Portion size wasn’t quite enough and there was a need for pudding (shame 😉) The puddings were good especially the banana split. 😃  Average restaurant with an average price.
