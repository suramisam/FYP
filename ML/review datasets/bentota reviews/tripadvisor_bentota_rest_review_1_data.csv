It is one of our favourite places to eat.  

It is a small...family run cafe and as there is only the wife doing the cooking and husband front of house, you may have to be patient in waiting for your food to arrive but when the food does come it is delicious and worth the wait.  

There was 6 of us and we shared dishes of prawns cooked in garlic, noodles, devilled chicken, country rice, chicken curry and beetroot curry.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  

So if you are looking for a small restaurant with great food Prem Cafe is the place to go.  

Thank you for having us again Prem and see you next time we are in Sri Lan family run cafe and as there is only the wife doing the cooking and husband front of house, you may have to be patient in waiting for your food to arrive but when the food does come it is delicious and worth the wait.

The chilli prawns were perfectly plump and popped in your mouth, bursting with the most deliciously spiced flavours. We were a bit disappointed not to have the Sri Lankan-style lobster which they didn’t have for the day, but the substitute of cuttle fish in traditional spices (and my request for freshly chopped chilli) was just as amazing an alternative. 
In addition, we were presented with a complimentary fresh mixed garden salad as a starter, and ended with a complimentary most delectable homemade cashew and honey ice cream!
Our young waiter was Prince Charming himself, who served us most attentively, presenting our table initially with pretty pink mangrove flowers that literally open up in front of your eyes whilst dining, and ending my romantic evening with a bunch of same said flowers to take home.

Not knowing the Sri Lanka further than the guide books, we were so grateful for how friendly and hospitable the staff were.

We sat down on some...sun loungers for Fanta, then beers and a swim in the sea (with a towel provided by the bar) before sitting down for one the best seafood meals we’ve eaten for quite a long time. The catch of the day (A massive Indian Mackerel) was shown to us before they cooked it. Clearly caught that morning. Fresh as you like. It came grilled to absolute perfection and dressed with a soy and lime sauce that was spot on with its simplicity. Rice and some garlic butter with Roti. Complemented the mackerel so so so well. Then the prawns! Just go here and eat them. I’m not a food writer. 

Once we’d finished, the owner drove us back to our hotel for no extra cost. Incredibly good value, service and food.
