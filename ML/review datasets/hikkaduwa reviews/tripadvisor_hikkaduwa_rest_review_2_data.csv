I've been back a...couple of times since then, in the summer of 2019 I stayed in a nearby villa so we called in several times. 

In November '23 we were again staying in nearby Hikkaduwa on an all-inclusive package but took a ride up to Asian Jewel for lunch. 

Having said that the curries are amazing, it's worth mentioning that Dale, the owner (and local Karaoke star) serves an extensive range of ex-pat favourites including fish& chips, 'English' breakfasts and Sunday roast dinners. 

But it was the curry that drew me back, and it didn't disappoint, it never disappoints.

So we were lucky to find this place was open although the chances of getting some customers were pretty bad. The restaurant was clean and inviting. The staff was extraordinary friendly and competent to deal with our requests. The menu is definitely big enough to fit most customers.

We had a really flavorful Sri Lankan rice & curry: pumpkin curry, dhal curry, fried eggplant, coconut sambal and mango chutney with rice and papadam. Great value for money. We also tried our first wood apple juice. The chef mixed the fruit with coconut milk, vanilla and sugar. An extraordinary taste!

We saw this beautiful location and directly booked the double room with a huge terrace where you could see the ocean, doing yoga, enjoying mornings and evenings. 

Waking up to soft...waves - having a beach directly to your feet in combination with the best coffee and food felt like heaven on earth. Steffi, Techni and all the other Crew were always right there and made all our wishes come true - just ask them. You will have a quite place to sleep with a lot of opportunities / Bars/ Restaurants around the Mandala if you fancy a louder place or so. We were very pleased by the smooth relaxing feeling , the location gave us. Perfect also, if you have to combine working and vacation. 

The room and space was always super clean. The shower was really nice, the double room had enough space and much natural light.

You can rent surfboards right next to the location, grocery stores are a few meters away and you are very close to the city.

Our flight was leaving super late on the day of the check out and we could stay here , leaving our backoacks at the bar - enjoying the waves and sunset. 

Make sure you definitely stay longer here, when you book the paradise right on the beach. 

Our number 1 recommendation for Hikkaduwa!

We went there really hungry and we are pretty used to wait for a long time in different parts of Sri Lanka for food and drinks but we got our drinks pretty fast and food also...in a normal time range. Burger with prawns was really tasty - prawns were so fresh and tender; also we ordered calamari and tuna tataki for starters - loved them! And my husband got prawns with rice - also really good and so many big prawns! 
Drinks were great and comparing to a hotel in Wadduwa the prices were cheaper and everything was faster, tasted better.

We got the Thai red and house curries they were both bursting with flavour! While the restaurant is a little bit out of the way I would say it is a must when in...Hikkaduwa.

Pool area is beautiful, all the sunbeds were ready for guests each morning with mattresses and towels. Even a little bell to call the staff if you want to...order a drink at the pool. Drinks and food very reasonable and excellent quality. Best place in town for proper English breakfast, with decent sausages and the works. Many people come to Asian Jewel just for meals as the food is that good.
It is in a peaceful location overlooking a river. We loved watching a big flock of eagles flying above while in the pool. First time staying here but will definitely be ba order a drink at the pool.

For breakfast Asian Jewel Special - you start the day happy and full. Shepherds Pie - OMG this combination of fresh minced meat and mashed potatoes....and that sauce! Great!...You'll want to lick the plate. 
Third time I ate Rogan Josh - really well seasoned and very tender lamb. An unforgettable taste experience, shout out to the chef.
The dishes are very appetizing and while you eat you can enjoy the beautiful view of the lake. The waiter was very courteous but not too pushy and also a bit funny, very pleasant. Go there and you will go out hap You'll want to lick the plate.

The food was wholesome and delicious with amazing presentation. There are some comfy beanbags which were great for our kids to sit on.

There was a lovely young guy working there who switched the bread on our kids food to a softer pitta bread so it would be easier for them to eat - his idea and they loved it! They were very helpful too in making up lovely fruit places for them to eat. Even in power blackouts they had a special menu which was great also.

We saw this beautiful location and directly booked the double room with a huge terrace where you could see the ocean, doing yoga, enjoying mornings and evenings. 

Waking up to soft...waves - having a beach directly to your feet in combination with the best coffee and food felt like heaven on earth. Steffi, Techni and all the other Crew were always right there and made all our wishes come true - just ask them. You will have a quite place to sleep with a lot of opportunities / Bars/ Restaurants around the Mandala if you fancy a louder place or so. We were very pleased by the smooth relaxing feeling , the location gave us. Perfect also, if you have to combine working and vacation. 

The room and space was always super clean. The shower was really nice, the double room had enough space and much natural light.

You can rent surfboards right next to the location, grocery stores are a few meters away and you are very close to the city.

Our flight was leaving super late on the day of the check out and we could stay here , leaving our backoacks at the bar - enjoying the waves and sunset. 

Make sure you definitely stay longer here, when you book the paradise right on the beach. 

Our number 1 recommendation for Hikkaduwa!
