Also, they only serve vegetarian food, which was a refreshing change from other places which have limited veg options."

The food was wholesome and delicious with amazing presentation. There are some comfy beanbags which were great for our kids to sit on. What made this place stand out for...us was the exceptional service. There was a lovely young guy working there who switched the bread on our kids food to a softer pitta bread so it would be easier for them to eat - his idea and they loved it! They were very helpful too in making up lovely fruit places for them to eat. Even in power blackouts they had a special menu which was great also. Lovely vibe in this pla us was the exceptional service.

We saw this beautiful location and directly booked the double room with a huge terrace where you could see the ocean, doing yoga, enjoying mornings and evenings. 

Waking up to soft...waves - having a beach directly to your feet in combination with the best coffee and food felt like heaven on earth. Steffi, Techni and all the other Crew were always right there and made all our wishes come true - just ask them. You will have a quite place to sleep with a lot of opportunities / Bars/ Restaurants around the Mandala if you fancy a louder place or so. We were very pleased by the smooth relaxing feeling , the location gave us. Perfect also, if you have to combine working and vacation. 

The room and space was always super clean. The shower was really nice, the double room had enough space and much natural light.

You can rent surfboards right next to the location, grocery stores are a few meters away and you are very close to the city.

Our flight was leaving super late on the day of the check out and we could stay here , leaving our backoacks at the bar - enjoying the waves and sunset. 

Make sure you definitely stay longer here, when you book the paradise right on the beach. 

Our number 1 recommendation for Hikkaduwa!
