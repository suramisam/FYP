Tried fish and chips and it was really tasty, also a really big portion - I suggest to share it with your partner :) the same goes...to avocado toast. 
All the food going to the tables looked really tasty and all the portions were pretty big - worth the money. 
You can eat inside (with AC) or outside to avocado toast.

It is such a lovely, ambient spot and the way the roof thatch is intertwined with greenery, it casts lovely shaddows across the restaurant.
The staff are lovely.
The smoothies are to die for....We tried a different meal each time and everything was excellent.
We even bought some of the incense sticks as the smell when you enter the restaurant is divine.
Our only crticism is that they do not open for dinner - otherwise we would have visited even mor We tried a different meal each time and everything was excellent.

Which I think is ridiculous; given the pricing of the food.
It would be good if they inform you BEFORE the meal that cash is the preferred method of payment."

I think we're probably their oldest customers as attracts surfers, beach goers and trendy tourists. We sat in the air conditioned section and had coffee, a little strong for our taste, but lovely...setting with access to the beach and efficient service.
