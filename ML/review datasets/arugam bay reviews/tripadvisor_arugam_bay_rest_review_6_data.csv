They are good and we are pizza snobs, no not up to the standards we're used to at...home but great for Sri Lanka and we've eaten a few on our 2 months here. To top it off though, the salad was great, the staff super friendly/fun and the music good. Sadly they are currently using plastic straws but promised they have ordered metal ones for next season, great ne home but great for Sri Lanka and we've eaten a few on our 2 months here.

Both were top quality! The pasta was cooked al dente and the pizza was delicious. 
The only thing that would make it better would be Parmesan cheese for the pasta, but we are in Sri Lanka not Italy...and the mozzarella works ok as substitute.
100rs extra for take away pizza  and the mozzarella works ok as substitute.
