the BBQ, rice, vegetables and curry.

Due to Covid the owner has no restaurant anymore and cooks exclusively for people he meets on the beach or street. He discusses the menu with the people and then...buys the things fresh from the market.

The owner and his family are super friendly. Dinner takes place at his house‚Äòs roof top close to the main road which is quite special but offers an alternative and great atmosphere.

Totally recommend to try this o buys the things fresh from the market.

Calamaris I didn‚Äôt recognize in the plate actually. Everything was fine but  too much salty and it was not good as I didn‚Äôt taste the food. I think it is better to ask beforehand not to...salt too much and then it would be just great. 
Waiting time is too long. We were waiting for 1 hour for our foo salt too much and then it would be just great.
