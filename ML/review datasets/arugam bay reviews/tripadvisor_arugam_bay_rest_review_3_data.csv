We drove into this very dark side road, a few 100 m from the main road. When we entered...this ‚Äûrestaurant‚Äú we were surprised as this was not really a restaurant but someones backyard. The place was really dark and there were no other people in this restaurant, which we thought was very weird for a restaurant which is rated as the best one in Arugam Bay. The whole ambiance was somewhat shady but we decided not to judge a book by its cover and ordered 2 burgers.
The day after, we did some more detailed research on this restaurant as we were still stunned of what we experienced the night before.
We also noticed that there were basically no pictures from guests on tripadvisor which is also a little bit weird for a restaurant that is rated as number 1 on tripadvisor.
And then the next kind of surprising thing we noticed was that the second best rated restaurant (Neptunes Best) in Arugam Bay, is at the exact same location. 

The food was alright and so was the owner but overall we did not like this experience and we did not feel very comfortable during our time at that restaurant/backyard, especially as we were the only guests at this dark pla this ‚Äûrestaurant‚Äú we were surprised as this was not really a restaurant but someones backyard.
