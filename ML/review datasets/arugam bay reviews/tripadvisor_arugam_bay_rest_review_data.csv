No problem, next bf we had lots of pineapple 😊 eggs are also really nice. Espresso is good too (lavazza, with a stovetop)

This should be our first sign that something was off but no I said we shouldn't be so narrow minded and give this place a chance. Then this guy brought us three different menus for different restaurants that was all on TA. That should be our cue to leave the place but still no, we had to be adventurous. He offered a grilled seafood plater for all five of us for 8,5k LKR/person. So 125 $!!! We instead chose 3 prawns, 1 calamari and 1 tuna grilled menu. He then started the home made grilled on the yard near our skuters and preparing the bbq. We were just looking at each other watching the signs of different restaurants which for sure were picked from closed restaurants and brought by this guy to his backyard. Look I'm all for backyard bbq with friends but this is supposed to be a place of business so it was beyond wierd. At the end we finished eating in record time so we could be out of there asap. Kids and our friend eat their prawns, my wife left some tuna on a bloody side and I left all my calamari cause they were completely cold. I hide them under the salad on plate but the guy found them and started asking why I didn't eat everything on my plate. I said I wasn't hungry we went on our bikes while he was talking about expecting a good review from us. Of course he rounded up the bill too for about 500 LKR.

Chicken salad - chicken is overcooked. Impossible to eat.

They're so flexible with the food items they provide, if you want it non spicy, without whatever you don't like they'd do for you. They're so caring and supportive to their customers, in the end you'd leave as a friend of Mahesh, not as a customer.

The open mic sessions they do are simply amazing as well and they have different games you can play while you wait for your food or even after having food.

We drove into this very dark side road, a few 100 m from the main road. When we entered...this „restaurant“ we were surprised as this was not really a restaurant but someones backyard. The place was really dark and there were no other people in this restaurant, which we thought was very weird for a restaurant which is rated as the best one in Arugam Bay. The whole ambiance was somewhat shady but we decided not to judge a book by its cover and ordered 2 burgers.
The day after, we did some more detailed research on this restaurant as we were still stunned of what we experienced the night before.
We also noticed that there were basically no pictures from guests on tripadvisor which is also a little bit weird for a restaurant that is rated as number 1 on tripadvisor.
And then the next kind of surprising thing we noticed was that the second best rated restaurant (Neptunes Best) in Arugam Bay, is at the exact same location. 

The food was alright and so was the owner but overall we did not like this experience and we did not feel very comfortable during our time at that restaurant/backyard, especially as we were the only guests at this dark pla this „restaurant“ we were surprised as this was not really a restaurant but someones backyard. The place was really dark and there were no other people in this restaurant, which we thought was very weird for a restaurant which is rated as the best one in Arugam Bay. The whole ambiance was somewhat shady but we decided not to judge a book by its cover and ordered 2 burgers.
The day after, we did some more detailed research on this restaurant as we were still stunned of what we experienced the night before.

First time ever that reviews were so deceptive. This dinner - if we can call it like that - was such a surreal experience. As said based on TA recommendation we ended at...this back alley off the main street whith one lady invited us to the yard in front of her house. This should be our first sign that something was off but no I said we shouldn't be so narrow minded and give this place a chance. Then this guy brought us three different menus for different restaurants that was all on TA. That should be our cue to leave the place but still no, we had to be adventurous. He offered a grilled seafood plater for all five of us for 8,5k LKR/person. So 125 $!!! We instead chose 3 prawns, 1 calamari and 1 tuna grilled menu. He then started the home made grilled on the yard near our skuters and preparing the bbq. We were just looking at each other watching the signs of different restaurants which for sure were picked from closed restaurants and brought by this guy to his backyard. Look I'm all for backyard bbq with friends but this is supposed to be a place of business so it was beyond wierd. At the end we finished eating in record time so we could be out of there asap. Kids and our friend eat their prawns, my wife left some tuna on a bloody side and I left all my calamari cause they were completely cold. I hide them under the salad on plate but the guy found them and started asking why I didn't eat everything on my plate. I said I wasn't hungry we went on our bikes while he was talking about expecting a good review from us. Of course he rounded up the bill too for about 500 LKR.

Look I'm all for backyard bbq with friends but this is supposed to be a place of business so it was beyond wierd. At the end we finished eating in record time so we could be out of there asap. Kids and our friend eat their prawns, my wife left some tuna on a bloody side and I left all my calamari cause they were completely cold. I hide them under the salad on plate but the guy found them and started asking why I didn't eat everything on my plate. I said I wasn't hungry we went on our bikes while he was talking about expecting a good review from us. Of course he rounded up the bill too for about 500 LKR. We are back at our hotel and still talking about this and waiting for the toilet call to kick in. PLEASE skip this shady place."

It consisted of 2 whole fish, scampi(giant prawns), prawns, calamari, all cooked on a coal fire with a garlic sauce over them.
It could have been served with chips and salad, but we asked for and got...rice with our meal.
It was all delicious. When we got it we thought that we would not be able to finish all the seafood, but we managed to demolish it. Yu rice with our meal.

The food was terrible. It cost an arm and a leg and it took AGES to arrive? Honestly I couldn’t even eat it. Went straight to the convenience store to buy snacks instead. We...even got mango juices which tasted like infused water with pulp? Worst part is as soon as we sat down I said to myself “this is going to be bad” but I persevered anyway thinking oh it could be a knock out backyard feast who knows… nope. It’s not.

It's not a restaurant. Seems to be the restaurant was closed and the name with billboard was taken by any guy who named his own home yard the same.

Avocado salad - a lot of big pieces of onion. Bad peeled onion.
Beef burger...- it's impossible to eat that cutlet.  Disgusting taste and smell.
Chicken salad - chicken is overcooked. Impossible to eat.

We've been surprised this difference of reviews and reality and we managed to find review that the owner is subsequently looking in the city for those who leave bad reviews and make scandals, forcing them to be removed.
Judging by the number of questions about our stay, this seems to be true. 
That's why this review was wrote after leaving Arugam B - it's impossible to eat that cutlet.  Disgusting taste and smell.

Simple restaurant is fine but the food was poor. First red snapper was raw. In fairness it was returned and the second one was v tasty. Tuna...was thin, overcooked and difficult to eat due to bones. Prawns were most definitely not fresh and a couple were not edible. All came with the same brown onion sauce along with rice and noodles which were fine if bland. Saving grace…. It was cheap.
