Purely to make my father in law jealous back home, I asked the staff if there was a curry for breakfast one morning, Thili and Gayan were only too happy to oblige even though the fish curry they served me was strictly speaking not even on the menu that day, true stars.
And so lastly I must thank Thili, Gayan and all the staff at the seahorse for their hospitality, for making my stay in Arugam bay such a special one and not least of all for their Michelin stared pizza.

Karma Gardens is run by a pair of down-to-earth Australian brothers (Matt and Brad), both vegans themselves so everything on the menu has been with genuine thought and love. 

The cafe is a 5-10 minute walk...from the main stretch in Arugam, surrounded by grassy fields and a large, flowery garden.

It's peaceful enough to get some work done (great free WiFi) or have a long conversation with a friend over food and drinks. 

They offer a range of smoothie bowls, toasts / rottis, burgers, filling salads, as well as freshly made juices, coffees and teas, etc. 

I'd recommend trying their weekend-special Seitan burgers, or the Kurrukan Rotis (with avo or bruschetta), and their Tumeric latte. All the smoothie bowl combos are delicious, too.  from the main stretch in Arugam, surrounded by grassy fields and a large, flowery garden.

Leaf & vine was absolutely fantastic. When the team knew it was my birthday they arranged a special song with the live...musician & fireworks. It was really special. The team are super friendly and welcoming and took the time to talk to us & recommend dishes. 

The live music was excellent, we recommended songs and even got a shout out. Great entertainment with a chilled environment. 

The food is perfection, we ordered the mango prawn curry and chilli prawns. Beautiful, fresh and so tasty, I would highly recommend this gorgeous location for dinner, drinks & a get together in the stunning arugam bay. You can see & hear the sea waves, watch the sunset and soak in the atmosphere.
