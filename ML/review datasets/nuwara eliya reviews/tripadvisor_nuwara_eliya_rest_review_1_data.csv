Big minus because of the confusing service/staff and prices.
Third time they send us upstairs in the 2nd Floor(the hotel restaurant), even If we said we want to stay at the 1st floor.

Lot's of the items...on the menu are not available and no prices.

On the 2nd floor, most of the waiters speak poor english.
They charged more, were constantly standing next to us while we were eating, brought food what we did not order and also opened a waterbottle without asking.

There is a lunch buffet on the 1st floor, which was comunicated to us with naan bread included.
We had to pay extra in the end.

Feel very sorry for this review, because the food was one of the best I/we had after 2months Sri Lanka.
