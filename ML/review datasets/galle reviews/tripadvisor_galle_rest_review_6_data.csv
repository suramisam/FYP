It was a good move!

2 delectable courses later (Carpaccio di funghi / Tomato jelly...caprese to start; Risotto di mare / Ravioli di magro) plus an excellent bottle of Italian Gewürztraminer down, all in a classy and cool setting as respite form the heat, we were ready to brave Galle again in the afterno caprese to start; Risotto di mare / Ravioli di magro) plus an excellent bottle of Italian Gewürztraminer down, all in a classy and cool setting as respite form the heat, we were ready to brave Galle again in the afternoon."

The prices are in fact no higher than you would pay for this quality in London or New York:...but they come as rather a shock in Sri Lanka.  The restaurant is part of a small chain which includes a bakery and pizzeria in Galle and some outlets elsewhere in the count but they come as rather a shock in Sri Lanka.

The quality of the food was amazing and although not huge amounts the flavours made up for this in a big way. A...bit more expensive compared to other local restaurants but this was a special event and well worth the extra we paid.

Lovely decor, great service and world class food. We felt a bit guilty about going to an Italian restaurant in SriLanka - but so glad we did. Such a beautifully designed room was a delight to sit in - variations of...white and cream. And the food to as good as anywhere - London, New York, Rome! Just delicious.

The Italian food is as good as anywhere in the world and authentic. The place is simple and elegant. The service friendly and helpful.

We went for the 7-course tasting menu, which was unreal. Portion sizes were generous, and the flavor was delicious and complex. Service was friendly and attentive. The setting is romantic and sophisticated, yet relaxed."

The staff were discrete and attentive, and the setting relaxed and classy. The highlight however was the food! By Sri Lankan standards it is not cheap (mid/high European...prices), but well worth it for the quality and complexity of the dishes.

Well they loved it. And we did to actually. Excellent Italian restaurant with everything you...would expect. The pastas were just perfect!One little remark: the limoncello could be better would expect. The pastas were just perfect!One little remark: the limoncello could be better :)"

In the context of the average restaurant’s in Sri Lanka it is a cut above. The setting is lovely. I loved the vibe, the linen tablecloths. It was clean. I liked that all...the dishes had wine pairings. I thought considering the ingredients and alcohol choices the price was fair. The staff were very attentive, polite and happy to amend things or get us separate pasta dishes for the kids if we so wished. A few things I would like to recommend to elevate the experience and make people want to come back. 
Don’t just serve oil with bread. Maybe leave a little oil/balsamic on the table. Make sure the bread is fresh baked and not almost stale. Fat on lamb needs to be rendered down. The meat was cooked well but the fat all around was inedible. The chicken dish was well cooked, and tender but was so oily it overpowered the taste of everything else. I felt like a few of the dishes weren’t ‘complete’ dishes. The steak for example, with no carb option. Albeit we added roast potatoes. The passion fruit panna cotta for desert had brilliant flavors. But both the meringue and panna cotta were over done.  I really enjoyed my carpaccio for starter, and my husband enjoyed his escalopes. Overall good.

Bread came out stale and was only served with olive oil. I asked for salt and balsamic but it was never brought to the table. I ordered the zucchini carpaccio and the home...made ravioli both ok but definitely missing the wow factor. The drinks are good. The service was slow and hardly inviting. I was also brought out a glass of water at the towards the end probably because it the waiter forgot to bring it at the beginning.

Tried eggplant for starter and gnocci and chicken for mains. From start to finish it was a flawless experience. The owners, including the head chef, came to our table several times to chat and deliver...our food. The food was authentic and the wine was excellent too. All the servers were friendly and attentive. We hope to return next time we visit Sri Lan our food. The food was authentic and the wine was excellent too. All the servers were friendly and attentive.
