The service is very nice, the food is very tasty and presented in an exemplary manner, accompanied by very good music.  You can enter from...Colombo Main Road and straight from the beach.  This is a place worth recommending and not sparing money.  It's easy to get here because it is close to the Radisson Blu hot Colombo Main Road and straight from the beach.

It‚Äôs wonderful.  A fantastic bamboo building, with cool music, fabulous food and drinks and complimentary sun beds just outside.  It‚Äôs right on the beach next to the Radisson Blu hotel (we...did not stay there but in a much smaller and lovely guest house called Urban Galle Villa). Dylan and his guys made us feel so welcome.  We had lunch and dinner there and each time it was cooked to perfection and the coffee was the best I had in Sri Lanka.

We enjoyed the food with a quiet view of the beach. Service was great and we would have come back again if our stay in Galle was not...so short. I loved the minimalist aesthetic of the building structure as it opened up to a beautiful view of the beach. No frills, just all round beach vib so short.
