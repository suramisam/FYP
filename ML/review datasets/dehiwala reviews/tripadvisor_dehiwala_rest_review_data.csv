I took my family and my extended family and in-laws as it was my Birthday on this day and wanted...to give them a good time. 
From the start it was just dissapointing as we were offered a table which is too far away from the buffet when we had old people and little infants who can barely walk that distance but since it was a last minute booking we did not complain.
The buffet was an utter dissapointment. We went to the restaurent and started the buffet around 8.15pm but certain dishes were already empty with no one to refill. My wife and in-laws came and complained me this as I was with my little one waiting till others get themselves food. I went directly to the buffet then to find out certain dishes are empty, even the soup container is empty , no buns for starters, etc. I looked around and no one was aroud. Then I talked to a chef who was passing by and showed him that their is no food in these and we are here to eat not just to walk around. Then suddenly a manager came by and said we will refill but at the time they did most of us have finished eating and it was embarrassing for me as I took them here for a start hotel to give them a good meal ended up in this manner. Also the selections available were so limited it is not paying 6000 lkr per person for such limited buffet.
The staff was lethargic and dont know what they need to do. 
Even we booked the table was not prepared and did so only when we arrived. The tables did not have enough cutlery as we had to ask each time for a spoon, knife, etc. and to find a waiter to ask for one is the hardest as they were no where to find.
The desserts were very limited and when I went into get desserts their were no spoons, forks available and no one around and again I had to ask from a chef who went passing by to get some spoons and forks. So the arrangements are very unprofessional. Also after my complain that why some dishes are empty and not being refilled some waiters and some from kitchen department had an argument in the restaurent as the kitchen staff said they should be informed of what needs to be refilled from restaurent waiters else how they know what is required.
So overall this was a very bad experience for me and the people who came with me and being an old star hotel which is very reputed for their service and food has now gone down to the bottom and i will not recommend anyone this buffet as it is not a buffet and not worth the price.
After all this disappointment when we were leaving  some gentleman by the name Lasantha if my memory is correct approched us and apolagised us about the incidents that took place. Then I informed it was my birthday and I took all these people all the way from Colombo to your hotel to have a good meal and quality time and ended up very badly. Then he regret and said his manager will call me and took my number and then said sorry for what happened and as a compliment we will send you a Birthday cake on behalf of the hotel. Now it is more than a month and I never got a call neither the cake which is I am not after but with all this drama they just apologise and then top it uo with a big fat lie such as that. So my conclusion is never even go to this restaurant for a buffet as they have very minimum selection,  no refills,  unprofessional staff service and a set of fat liers who burn the top chairs of the manageme to give them a good time. 
From the start it was just dissapointing as we were offered a table which is too far away from the buffet when we had old people and little infants who can barely walk that distance but since it was a last minute booking we did not complain.
The buffet was an utter dissapointment. We went to the restaurent and started the buffet around 8.15pm but certain dishes were already empty with no one to refill. My wife and in-laws came and complained me this as I was with my little one waiting till others get themselves food. I went directly to the buffet then to find out certain dishes are empty, even the soup container is empty , no buns for starters, etc. I looked around and no one was aroud. Then I talked to a chef who was passing by and showed him that their is no food in these and we are here to eat not just to walk around. Then suddenly a manager came by and said we will refill but at the time they did most of us have finished eating and it was embarrassing for me as I took them here for a start hotel to give them a good meal ended up in this manner. Also the selections available were so limited it is not paying 6000 lkr per person for such limited buffet.

I took my family and my extended family and in-laws as it was my Birthday on this day and wanted...to give them a good time. 
From the start it was just dissapointing as we were offered a table which is too far away from the buffet when we had old people and little infants who can barely walk that distance but since it was a last minute booking we did not complain.
The buffet was an utter dissapointment. We went to the restaurent and started the buffet around 8.15pm but certain dishes were already empty with no one to refill. My wife and in-laws came and complained me this as I was with my little one waiting till others get themselves food. I went directly to the buffet then to find out certain dishes are empty, even the soup container is empty , no buns for starters, etc. I looked around and no one was aroud. Then I talked to a chef who was passing by and showed him that their is no food in these and we are here to eat not just to walk around. Then suddenly a manager came by and said we will refill but at the time they did most of us have finished eating and it was embarrassing for me as I took them here for a start hotel to give them a good meal ended up in this manner. Also the selections available were so limited it is not paying 6000 lkr per person for such limited buffet.
The staff was lethargic and dont know what they need to do. 
Even we booked the table was not prepared and did so only when we arrived. The tables did not have enough cutlery as we had to ask each time for a spoon, knife, etc. and to find a waiter to ask for one is the hardest as they were no where to find.
The desserts were very limited and when I went into get desserts their were no spoons, forks available and no one around and again I had to ask from a chef who went passing by to get some spoons and forks. So the arrangements are very unprofessional. Also after my complain that why some dishes are empty and not being refilled some waiters and some from kitchen department had an argument in the restaurent as the kitchen staff said they should be informed of what needs to be refilled from restaurent waiters else how they know what is required.
So overall this was a very bad experience for me and the people who came with me and being an old star hotel which is very reputed for their service and food has now gone down to the bottom and i will not recommend anyone this buffet as it is not a buffet and not worth the price.
After all this disappointment when we were leaving  some gentleman by the name Lasantha if my memory is correct approched us and apolagised us about the incidents that took place. Then I informed it was my birthday and I took all these people all the way from Colombo to your hotel to have a good meal and quality time and ended up very badly. Then he regret and said his manager will call me and took my number and then said sorry for what happened and as a compliment we will send you a Birthday cake on behalf of the hotel. Now it is more than a month and I never got a call neither the cake which is I am not after but with all this drama they just apologise and then top it uo with a big fat lie such as that. So my conclusion is never even go to this restaurant for a buffet as they have very minimum selection,  no refills,  unprofessional staff service and a set of fat liers who burn the top chairs of the manageme to give them a good time.

Dining Rea - Amazingly natural and they have a huge place spread over for dining area segregated in different sections. Indoor and outdoor seating facilities are available. 

Menu - Food menu planning is nicely done and have ample of choices starting from appetizers, mains, grill, sizzlers, dessert and more. The menu is not only restricted to seafood but other cuisines & dishes are available as well. Vegetarians please don't get upset. You have choices as well.

Beverage - good and wide selection of beverages - alcoholic and non-alcoholic both and priced reasonably.

Staff - Quick and efficient enough. We had a  service person who speaks a bit of our language and tried to impress us. That's nice of him.

Tips - Tipping is not mandatory as they have 10% service charge on the total bill but it's upto you and depends on your generous pocket. 

Overall - A must visit place. It surely gives you a feeling of sea side shack if you are seating outdoor. They have an evening live music as well - not sure everyday or not but it was there on Sunday eveni experience.

They have the most amazing flavor sum kottu. You get Chicken, Beef, Prawns, Egg and  vegetarian as well. They pretty much tweak the menu according to the demand. Usually they offer about 9 different types...of kottu, Roast chicken, Roast chicken with cheese, Deviled chicken, Nai Miris chicken (Very hot), Stir fried Negombo Prawns, Chili beef (Hot), Chili beef  cheese and Egg or Vegi with cheese. The curry provided is also yummy but they don't offer curry for all Kottu types. The ratio of protein to Veg to starch could be adjusted a bit for more quality but that's my personal opinion. Dilshan the operations manager is very friendly and offers great service. The guys doing the food preparation is also friendly and smiles when ever I revisit. It's a food truck so you only get take away food. I would recommend their food to anyone. If you really don't like hot food, just tell them and they will adjust according to your request. They only open for dinner and they rotate within Colombo. You can also book them for events and parties. My advise to the Road house team is to continue their consistency.

Then we decided on the jumbo 1.8kg crab and asked for it to be prepared as Sri Lankan style curry.  They have other options on how to prepare the crab as well.

I took my family and my extended family and in-laws as it was my Birthday on this day and wanted...to give them a good time. 
From the start it was just dissapointing as we were offered a table which is too far away from the buffet when we had old people and little infants who can barely walk that distance but since it was a last minute booking we did not complain.
The buffet was an utter dissapointment. We went to the restaurent and started the buffet around 8.15pm but certain dishes were already empty with no one to refill. My wife and in-laws came and complained me this as I was with my little one waiting till others get themselves food. I went directly to the buffet then to find out certain dishes are empty, even the soup container is empty , no buns for starters, etc. I looked around and no one was aroud. Then I talked to a chef who was passing by and showed him that their is no food in these and we are here to eat not just to walk around. Then suddenly a manager came by and said we will refill but at the time they did most of us have finished eating and it was embarrassing for me as I took them here for a start hotel to give them a good meal ended up in this manner. Also the selections available were so limited it is not paying 6000 lkr per person for such limited buffet.
The staff was lethargic and dont know what they need to do. 
Even we booked the table was not prepared and did so only when we arrived. The tables did not have enough cutlery as we had to ask each time for a spoon, knife, etc. and to find a waiter to ask for one is the hardest as they were no where to find.
The desserts were very limited and when I went into get desserts their were no spoons, forks available and no one around and again I had to ask from a chef who went passing by to get some spoons and forks. So the arrangements are very unprofessional. Also after my complain that why some dishes are empty and not being refilled some waiters and some from kitchen department had an argument in the restaurent as the kitchen staff said they should be informed of what needs to be refilled from restaurent waiters else how they know what is required.
So overall this was a very bad experience for me and the people who came with me and being an old star hotel which is very reputed for their service and food has now gone down to the bottom and i will not recommend anyone this buffet as it is not a buffet and not worth the price.
After all this disappointment when we were leaving  some gentleman by the name Lasantha if my memory is correct approched us and apolagised us about the incidents that took place. Then I informed it was my birthday and I took all these people all the way from Colombo to your hotel to have a good meal and quality time and ended up very badly. Then he regret and said his manager will call me and took my number and then said sorry for what happened and as a compliment we will send you a Birthday cake on behalf of the hotel. Now it is more than a month and I never got a call neither the cake which is I am not after but with all this drama they just apologise and then top it uo with a big fat lie such as that. So my conclusion is never even go to this restaurant for a buffet as they have very minimum selection,  no refills,  unprofessional staff service and a set of fat liers who burn the top chairs of the manageme to give them a good time.

One of the people in our group ordered the giant freshwater prawn in a Sri Lankan style curry.  Both curries came with a large plate of roasted bread.  The Crab and Prawn curries were excellent.  There is nothing like this in the USA.  If we order Crab there, it will be steamed and pretty bland.

This meal was expensive because we picked a huge crab, but I‚Äôll remember this for a long time and actually, I‚Äôm craving that crab curry right now.

Every staff member we interacted with at this restaurant was very nice.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants fresh seafood, especially Crab and Giant Prawns.

I‚Äôm hoping to go back again before our vacation en thing, the crab curry!   We asked to see the crab before making a decision, so they brought out the live crab.

The service was poor. We ordered some beers and a sizzling beef dish. The beef was like chewing on a hard leather belt. The dish had about 8 pieces...of beef strips cut to about 1 inch by 4cm and about 3cm thick. The whole dish was filled with onios, bellpepper. An absolute disastrous dish.
We did not dare to order any more food.

Response by the cashier to help resolve my problem with lost phone was...very much appreciated. But the response by the Manager Mr. Sam was outright rude and nasty.

Food : Tasty but the portion sizes are surprisingly small.

You can bring spirits and wine corkage fee. Beers are expensive nearly twice the price when you buy from liquor store.

Service is...ok.

They had a band played but after few songs they stopped. Next door was more busier and live ok.

Colombo. Sri Lanka

After watching a video clip by mark wein advertising how amazing the venue and food was,we decided to make the trip to go expecting an amazing evening,however we were really disappointed ,
We were left...waiting for over an hour and 45 minutes,
All they seem to be interested in  was for us to buy ordinary white wine at twenty pounds a bottle plus service charge,

We ordered prawns and was told there was no prawns available , there were two power cuts lasting at least 10 minutes with no apology or explanation.
All this coupled with cockroach and no lock on the toilets we decided to pay for our drinks which had added service charge for a terrible service we decided to leave .

Do not fall for Mark Wein's advertising and promoting this place .
It is a complete waste of time and a rip off charging eu prices with a sub standard service .
We have eaten in local outlets with much better service and value for mone waiting for over an hour and 45 minutes,

I had to wait 2 hours for my table, they gave us someone else's table and we almost ended up fighting with another group. Then they took 5...hours to give my food, 5 HOURS!!! I spent my entire 31st night talking to them instead of enjoying. They didn't even get me my water and drinks I ordered and then at 12am they tell me that the bar is closed when I ordered my drinks at 10. Best then I got my food at 1.30am where the order was incorrect and then we had to send it back and then when the brought they bill its had items we didn't even get. Yet they still tried to charge us for it. I literally didn't pay a cent. No one in my group agreed to pay it. They waiter kept messaging me to pay it and started bringing religion into the story and how God is watching. Which restaurant does this kind of thing. I had to call the manager and ask him to tell the waiter to stop messaging me. I used to go here so much and order from here but no more.
