When we arrived there was only a group of people sitting at one table, but by 8:30pm the place was packed. Everyone in our group lives in the USA, so we were here for one...thing, the crab curry!   We asked to see the crab before making a decision, so they brought out the live crab.  We ordered a few hot butter cuttlefish and some drinks to start, they were all great.  Then we decided on the jumbo 1.8kg crab and asked for it to be prepared as Sri Lankan style curry.  They have other options on how to prepare the crab as well. One of the people in our group ordered the giant freshwater prawn in a Sri Lankan style curry.  Both curries came with a large plate of roasted bread.  The Crab and Prawn curries were excellent.  There is nothing like this in the USA.  If we order Crab there, it will be steamed and pretty bland.

This meal was expensive because we picked a huge crab, but I’ll remember this for a long time and actually, I’m craving that crab curry right now.

Every staff member we interacted with at this restaurant was very nice.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants fresh seafood, especially Crab and Giant Prawns.

I’m hoping to go back again before our vacation en thing, the crab curry!   We asked to see the crab before making a decision, so they brought out the live crab.

The service was poor. We ordered some beers and a sizzling beef dish. The beef was like chewing on a hard leather belt. The dish had about 8 pieces...of beef strips cut to about 1 inch by 4cm and about 3cm thick. The whole dish was filled with onios, bellpepper. An absolute disastrous dish.

Food : Tasty but the portion sizes are surprisingly small.

You can bring spirits and wine corkage fee. Beers are expensive nearly twice the price when you buy from liquor store.

Service is...ok.

Colombo. Sri Lanka

After watching a video clip by mark wein advertising how amazing the venue and food was,we decided to make the trip to go expecting an amazing evening,however we were really disappointed ,
We were left...waiting for over an hour and 45 minutes,
All they seem to be interested in  was for us to buy ordinary white wine at twenty pounds a bottle plus service charge,

We ordered prawns and was told there was no prawns available , there were two power cuts lasting at least 10 minutes with no apology or explanation.
All this coupled with cockroach and no lock on the toilets we decided to pay for our drinks which had added service charge for a terrible service we decided to leave .

Do not fall for Mark Wein's advertising and promoting this place .
It is a complete waste of time and a rip off charging eu prices with a sub standard service .
We have eaten in local outlets with much better service and value for mone waiting for over an hour and 45 minutes,

Being someone that eats rice three times a day and being a huge foodie, I am extra critical about my food especially the rice based meals! My Chicken Lamprais today was just...off the charts and probably the best I've had!!

Firstly, it arrived in under 35 minutes, hot as ever almost as if it had just been cooked and sent to me right away. Secondly, there were so many different items offered with the rice which were so unique in preparation and flavour! A taste I've never experienced before! Thirdly, the portion was huge! I usually eat a lot and finish a big packet of rice all by myself but I struggled to finish this one as they were so generous with the quantity! Too generous!

I would give their Chicken Lamprais a 10/10 without batting an eyelid because it is every foodie's dream! Especially if you love rice! Thank you again Roo's Deli for giving me one of the most satisfying meals I have had in a while!! Definitely going to be one of your loyal customers and looking forward to ordering from you again very so off the charts and probably the best I've had!!
