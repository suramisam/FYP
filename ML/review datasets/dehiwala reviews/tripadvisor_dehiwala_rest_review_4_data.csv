Unfortunately, the level has fallen massively for some time. Catastrophic service. I waited 20 minutes again at a table on the terrace. While greeted remotely by a waiter, no menu, no drink....After 20 minutes gone.

The breeze and setting is beautiful.  Totally recommend.  It can be busy, so do book in advance.  The food is very good, Sri Lankan type which includes curry, rice...dishes and medium spice.  They have a great range.  You can also order western food too.  The staff are a little slow at getting drinks out, I had to ask a waiter twice, waiting over 20 minutes for a coke.  It's a great spot for couples as it gets dark, not so much for us with a toddler.  We ate inside night 2.  Do try, it's love dishes and medium spice.  They have a great range.

It can feel like itâ€™s a public pool area, not what youâ€™d expect when staying here.

Families come for lunch, many children are in supervised + run riot....Unpleasant.

The terrace itself is lovely.

My pasta had lot of artificial sauce and eventhough the taste was ok,I really didn't like it. We had to call for waiters and wait atleats for 5/10 minutes till someone shows up.
