Well presented tables and caring welcome and initial service.  Only limited Sri Lankan dishes on the menu but looked promising.  But the food was less fusion and more confusion.  Fancy presentation with very...one dimensional flavouring and poor balance on the plates.  It was expensive by Sri Lankan standards and would be poor value in London or San Francisco.  We were very disappointed in what reviews indicated was one of the best restaurants in Kandy.  The patrons clearly value form over substance.  There are better restaurants for less than half the price in to one dimensional flavouring and poor balance on the plates.

It's relaxing, cool and very spacious! Whether you're going alone or with a group, it has the accommodations! I personally recommend the Prawn Lagoon Curry. and the Lemon and Mint Sorbet.

So on this trip to Kandy, I thought we'll look it up. We saw it featured in the review of the  5 best restaurants in Kandy too. We decided to make dinner reservations with Russell,who was very...helpful. Its a cosy place up on the hills of Hantana. The ride up in a tuk was quite an experience. The downside was that we had to arrange for a ride back at higher rates. The manager helped us to secure a ride back, which was a great help. Therefore we were able to relax and look around and drink in the lovely view.
The place was really beautiful, the view of the town, though nighttime was magical. I did wish we could hv gone during the day! 
The dining area had a lovely ambience. And the menu was available on the site, so we could order quickly. There was lovely music playing softly which added to the ambience.
For dinner we ordered, the  Hot butter Cuttlefish, served with onion garlic rice,  Grilled Chicken  with bbq sauce served with mash potato and boiled vegetables, and chicken onion masala
served with paratha bread and cucumber raita.  Ordered soft drinks too. 
 We enjoyed the flavourful dishes very much, but would hv liked it if the grilled Chicken was more succulent. 
Service was excellent and the manager and staff were very attentive to us. We'll definitely come again, for lunch so helpful. Its a cosy place up on the hills of Hantana.

In reality it is a little tired. The issue we had with our stay here was the restaurant. Firstly it’s a lot more expensive than what’s on offer. The service was very slow and quite rude. We ordered our meal...at pretty much the same time of ordering our drinks. After a half hour and no food and seeing everyone else that came after us getting their meals, I asked the waiter where our meals were. She had forgotten and merely laughed it off. No apology, nothing! She said it wouldn’t take long. Another 20 minutes went by. I then asked the manager and he was very dismissive. Another 5 minutes and no food. We ended up leaving because it was late and by that time we were over waiting. So no diner. No apology. Other issues with this hotel: the restaurant was very hot. The fans on the balcony were not working. No air conditioning. Our suite was nice enough. Oh and the hot water wasn’t working for our morning shower. I spoke to the hotel manager in the morning and she was very argumentative. That’s the problem when hotels are pre-paid for the accommodation. There’s no accountability. It’s a shame because we only had one night in Kandy and really looked forward to the stay and dinner. I have rated this hotel very low because the half dozen other Sri Lankan hotels we stayed at of similar room rates, even in more expensive areas like Galle, were vastly superior in hospitality and servi at pretty much the same time of ordering our drinks.

Our first time here was for drinks only & the staff were so friendly. Arjuna served us on our first night & was so informative about the hotel/bars history....The ambiance in the bar & restaurant was so welcoming that we decided to stay as hotel guests on our return to Kandy & even decided to stay an extra night.

On our return we were again met with a very warm welcome with cold towels & a fresh king coconut drink. Both very welcome after a hectic 4 hour Tuk Tuk drive from Habarana (my husband was the driver). 

We booked a suite which was so quaint & quirky.  The room was spotless & even though quite close to the road it was very quiet.

The building is around a small central courtyard where you can sit to enjoy drinks & food. The bar downstairs is very popular with locals & they do an excellent selection of drinks both local & International. We ate downstairs on our second night & selected food from the 'bites' menu. Do not be fooled  this is not bitesized like we know in the UK & the portions are huge. Luckily the barman Abesekara gave us good advice when we asked for 2 portions of chicken Kottu & he said 1 portion would be enough! It definitely was. 

Abesekara is such a friendly guy & is none stop making sure everyone is OK & just running about keeping the place spot on. 

We also ate in the upstairs restaurant & sat on the terrace overlooking the street. This was a lovely spot to just watch the world go by. The food upstairs is also excellent. 

Breakfast at the hotel was a lovely relaxed experience with a selection of croissants/bread items, fresh fruit platter, eggs, juice & tea/coffee. 

This hotel/bar has lots of history & is a conserved building. There is a museum type room in the hotel that provides all of this information if you are so inclined. 

Excellent place to stay & located within a 10 min walk of the Temple of The Tooth Relic & 15 mins to the  bus/railway statio The ambiance in the bar & restaurant was so welcoming that we decided to stay as hotel guests on our return to Kandy & even decided to stay an extra night.

Very friendly staff.

The French Toast & caramelised banana was amazing, packed with taste.

The Lankan pancake crepes were also really good.

Fresh line...soda was spot on and really refreshing.

The chai masala was the worst I've had, ever, though.

The tea was way way too strong and overpowered the small amount of masala spices they used. This was definitely powder not fresh spices.

 At 550LKR a cup I had expected something better or at least to equal to the 350LKR I've had elsewhere.

But the French toast was of the scale good.

Really lovely service with a great waiter interested in James Bond (we’re from England so he was keen to chat).

We just had a couple of coffees and ice cream and it was fab. The coconut, banana and treacle ice cream in particular was AMAZING - so do order if you’re there.

Everything was just great. They listened to our wishes (we wanted to see and walk more and they just changed the plan). Our guide Murali was really funny and we had great time together. The storm...cought us, but we didn’t mind, it was an amazing experience. We saw all 6 waterfalls, a lot of tea plantations, villages with waving children :) and Murali showed us two endemits (lizards) and cinnamon, avocado, mango tree, spices and some other flowers.
