清潔で涼しくておしゃれで居心地が良い。街の喧騒（写真ご参照）とは一線を画す感じ。
日本人経営らしく、日本食のメニューも並んでいる。

お目当てのコーヒーは薄めでいまいちだったが、クレープが違和感ないおいしさで満足度高かった。
☆6　Coffee Leaf Tea Ice Shakerato (Italian Style) Rs. 520
カクテルみたいに、目の前でシェーカーで振ってくださって完成。
コーヒーと紅茶を混ぜたかのような薄味。飲み終わったら下に苦い粉末がたまっていた。

☆7　Home Roasted Coffee -Old Ceylon 1860s- Macchiato Single Rs.460
酸味強め、パンチあるコーヒー

★7.5Kandy Crepe Tuna & Fried Vegetable Rs.800
★7.5Kandy Crepe Chocolate & Banana Rs.700
もちもちクレープの王道のおいしさ。

お会計1500円弱。外国人観光客にとってはお値ごろだが、ローカル向けの価格ではない。"

Managed to locate it eventually with the help of a local guy in search of...a tip and then made our way to the rooftop being followed up the stairs by a slightly odd young man.

Once on the rooftop the scene was definitely not one for a family meal - exclusively male groups sat around smoking Shisha and staring at us in a way you don’t often see in Sri Lanka.

Sat down and were given a couple of wet, filthy menus. Then took my son to the toilet, the filthy floor of which was covered in urine. Walked back to the table past various more odd men lying down near the kitchen.

Eventually decided that we had seen enough and headed for the exit. Perhaps the food was great - although the raw meat lying around the kitchen surfaces didn’t inspire confidence - but we’ll never know. This is clearly the place for men who want to hang out conspiratorially at the top of buildings, but when travelling with a wife and daughter this didn’t feel like a great choi a tip and then made our way to the rooftop being followed up the stairs by a slightly odd young man.
