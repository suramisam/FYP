Choose from the menu and then your treat is made from scratch in just a few minutes. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúfried‚Äù but it‚Äôs formed on a very cold griddle; using paddles, the ice cream maestro flips and smashes...and twirls until the ice cream is formed, just right for eating. If you are a vegan, definitely go; I highly recommend the chocolate peanut butter! If you like dairy ice cream, definitely go! Since it‚Äôs all made from scratch, they easily accommodate dietary preferences. Some reviewers have said they shared one serving but it's so good, you'll want it all to yourself. The little parlor is clean with comfortable seating and the staff very nice. Parking can be difficult so if possible, take a tuk t and twirls until the ice cream is formed, just right for eating.

We decided to make dinner reservations with Russell,who was very...helpful. Its a cosy place up on the hills of Hantana. The ride up in a tuk was quite an experience. The downside was that we had to arrange for a ride back at higher rates. The manager helped us to secure a ride back, which was a great help. Therefore we were able to relax and look around and drink in the lovely view.
The place was really beautiful, the view of the town, though nighttime was magical. I did wish we could hv gone during the day! 
The dining area had a lovely ambience. And the menu was available on the site, so we could order quickly. There was lovely music playing softly which added to the ambience.
For dinner we ordered, the  Hot butter Cuttlefish, served with onion garlic rice,  Grilled Chicken  with bbq sauce served with mash potato and boiled vegetables, and chicken onion masala
served with paratha bread and cucumber raita.  Ordered soft drinks too. 
 We enjoyed the flavourful dishes very much, but would hv liked it if the grilled Chicken was more succulent.
