Situated practically on the beach, this spot offers stunning seafood and delicious homemade soups prepared by the owner, who is wholeheartedly involved in everything and always makes...time for a chat. The wait time is acceptable by European standards, placing it at the forefront of Sri Lankan dining experiences. I recommend it to everyone - I've practically tried everything on the menu and can't say a bad word about any of it. The prices are on the higher side for Tangalle, but I still felt that for such quality, it's definitely a bargain.
