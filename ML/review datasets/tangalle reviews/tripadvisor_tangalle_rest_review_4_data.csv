The owner is really nice and tries to make all your wishes come true. My Husband ate sea food and he said it was the best he ever ate and I'm vegan and he prepared me the most delisious dinner....It was all freshly prepared from scratch, so the wait was a bit longer, but it was worth it! And they have shisha (hookah) - amazing! Would recommend  It was all freshly prepared from scratch, so the wait was a bit longer, but it was worth it! And they have shisha (hookah) - amazing!

The restaurant is newly opened with just a few tables for now. All the people working there are really nice and helpful with your choice. Mahi mahi fish and baracudas are amazing, very well prepared...and really fresh. The checken was also amazing. For us, it is a best restaurant in Tangalle. It was affected by Covid-19 crisis and we hope it will gain its popularity again. Waiting times are maybe little bit longer, but it definitely worths.
