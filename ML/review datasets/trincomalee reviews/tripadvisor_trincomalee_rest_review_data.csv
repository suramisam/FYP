There are many curry dishes on offer.

The pasta was overdone, sticky and they forgot the shrimp. After 5 minutes, the waiter brought 6 shrimps on a plate. They were greasy and cooked but that was all.

You could think: okay, ordering pasta in Sri Lanka is at your own risk. But they even messed up the fish curry (Sri Lankan cuisine)... Tasted also like it was made with instant powdered stuff, very salty. And the fish tasted not fresh and was 10 times overcooked, really really dry. Even the papadum was not good: very greasy and I could bend the thing because it was not properly fried.  

We tried the food because we were that hungry but after a few bites we gave up. It was not a possibility to tell the waiter we did not like the food at all because he did not understand a thing we said. Out of good manner, we just paid him and left.

We started at 12:30 pm. First, we went to the shops together to buy the ingredients for the meals. 
Then we started cooking. We did two different types of Dhaal curry, two different types of egg plant curries,...Devil fish curry, pumpking curry and coconut sambol. They explained everything in detail and we could write everything down. Also they showed us some tricks to make the cutting of vegetables easier. We also cut vegetables etc. on our own.
We always tried the meals before to see if we have to add some spices etc. 
After cooking, we ate the meals! It was more than delicious!
Thank you so much for this experience. It was great
