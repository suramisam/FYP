In fact, it's probably the worst meal I've had in Sri Lanka so far.
We arrived to a basically empty restaurant, a friendly welcome and quick service.
We...ordered vegetable curry and rice, chicken chop suey and chips.
Where do I start... Chips came first, before the drinks and other meals. They were fine - you honestly can't go wrong with French fries. Next the drinks - tasty and cold and enough alcohol that it felt almost worth the money. Almost. 
The rest didn't go so well. The vegetable curry was a very odd (albeit local!) type of vegetable that I'd never come across, looked like a potato but couldn't put a fork in it and tasted like tough banana, or maybe a really tough potato like one that had been cooked twice then reheated in a microwave? Either way it was honestly the worst vegetable I've ever tried. The rice was cold. Like, cold enough that even flies weren't bothered by it cause there was literally no heat. Nope. Dahl was good. Potato thing was okay. That coconut sambal thing was dry and soggy.
My partner ordered chicken chop suey and there was no flavour AT ALL. Maybe his error, ordering an East Asian dish in a South Asian restaurant. There was also no chicken at all - just pure bones. Not great. 
In the waiters defence, he did offer us anything else off the menu for free, or extra Dahl. I declined based on those 2 dishes I wasn't prepared to put my stomach through another one.
Paid our most expensive bill of our trip so far and left... Won't be back. Don't recommend the food. 
Staff friendly enough and he did apologize a lot. Probably a great place for drinks with friends or their fresh seafo ordered vegetable curry and rice, chicken chop suey and chips.

From the other reviews (read after the disaster, unfortunately), the only reason we ate at the same time...is because we shared the same dish.
To be fair, the sauce of the seafood platter was however very tasty. Not worth the sickness, thou is because we shared the same dish.
