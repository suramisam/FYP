Husband had fish a few...times and it was always cooked to perfection (unlike some of the others who must have poached it for an hour!), we had a variety of meals here and all good value and nicely cooked.

Highly recommend it as the service is pretty quick, really nice chaps, well worth a visit or too. They did have fans blowing around the restaurant for the hot Europeans which did help as it did get really hot towards the end!

We would certainly come back to this restaurant an their rooms to rent sounded pretty good too.

Wonderful place, nice owner, delightful food as always. I hope TripAdvisor makes note of this review and change the status from ""closed"" to ""open""....Gaga restaurant is the oldest of the existing hotels in Ales Garden and is been operating since 2014.
