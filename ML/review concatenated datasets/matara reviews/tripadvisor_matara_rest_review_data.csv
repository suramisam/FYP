You could buy hummus in a supermarket which is much better than that. We ordered fajita , in the menu it said it come on a pita, but end up coming as a sandwich a very bad one .
Salad was salty and not fresh.

Before going into what was so so wrong at Baba's I really feel like questioning what people base their judgement on. How on earth could this place ever have got...anything above poor? 
We walked in, had to find our own table as all the staff were sat outside at the back by a tree chilling, having a beer and a chat. No acknowledgement, no nothing. We waited 5 minutes before having to call a guy over who seemed to have felt he had been disturbed from his lads night out.
We ordered veg spring rolls and rice and Curry. We stipulated the rolls were starters, though felt a bit stupid doing so as they were in the starter section....
After about 50 minutes two heavily greasy and over fried rolls came to us followed by, within about 15 seconds, our mains.
The rice and Curry was HORRID. Soy chunks, literally dumped on the side of the plate (we quickly scraped them onto a napkin and offered them to a passing stray dog who quickly ran off after taking a sniff), whole pieces of unmarinated jackfruit, not even salted or shredded, just dumped there, with something else the waiter couldn't even explain and what we identified as a Dhal. It took some heavy inspection (and it's pretty much all I've eaten for 20 days in sri lanka, but we managed to conclude it must be it)

Horrible service, horrible food, horrible everything. As Rick Astley once begged, please don't  anything above poor?

Nomad is short walk from the Marriott Hotel, and my kids and I ate there every day. It's a small outdoor seated cafe, with a lovely vibe and cheerful team. 

Their coffee, drinks,...Tuna Poke Bowl and Granola Fruit bowl with passion fruit were all delicious. 

Nomad is clearly a thoroughly professionally run business and it shows in the way the staff and food is presented. 

Nomad is always busy with guests - a true sign of a good business. 

I recommend it highly!

We ordered 2 dishes to share and coffee. The coffee was very good but the raw tuna in the tuna bowl was clearly not fresh and looked quite grey, also there were chewy parts as...the tuna was not cut  right. My appetite was gone, but my husband still ate it as he was very hungry. I still decided to mention it to the waiters as they better prevent happening this in the future. We showed the tuna, but they denied there was a problem. They ignored the problem fully and did not even apologise. I think Nomad is not aware of the fact that old raw tuna can make you sick (next tot that it is  very unpleasant to eat).
