I have also taken the cooking class from chef. This is not a standard offer but you could ask chef, if you are interested. I appreciated how he showed me how he prepares everything from scratch. People who just arrived in Sri Lanka do not have to be afraid of bad food here: everything is prepared when you order. The ingredients are fresh for sure!
