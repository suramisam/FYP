We’d read that Lagoon gave Ministry of Crab a run for its money. In fact our chef at the superlative Crab Factory at the Taj had  also recommended it, so we went with eager anticipation. 

The setting is beautiful,...a lush tropical lagoon. We ordered the cold platter with an assortment of crab, shrimp, oysters. Very average, considering that the freshness of the seafood should have shone through. The fried cuttlefish in tamarind sauce was fine. The baked carbs we ordered just so that we could revel in the pure taste of crab, not swamped by heavy curries, was the biggest letdown. It came doused with cheese and had just no distinctive flavour. The restaurant prides itself on its on-ice display of seafood you pick from, but this nuance is pointless since it’s not live, just displayed on beds of crushed ice, which is how they would be kept in the kitchen back-of-the-house anyway. 

Our recommended dessert was Knickerbocker Glory, the classic Brit melange of ice creams with fruit, sauce and cream. This was good.

Noticing that Tintagel does high tea,I booked same for two people for around a week later and couldn't wait, bcoz the food is always nice and well presented. Sadly, it was such an anticlimax. The food variety, presentation and taste were disappointing and I felt not quite to the rest of the venues standards, however, the homemade ginger beer was exquisite.

But to be honest, I would never come back to the hotel and that’s only because of the service. It’s slow, unanswered and beyond their care.

We have been chasing the staff for the smallest of things since we’ve checked in. 

It took them an hour to send a beer to our room and I can’t begin to tell you about the time it took them to bring the food. Most of the switches don’t work so our room is full of extension cords all around. If only they could serve a little better I would not leave the hotel.

Loved the spread on offer - from a variety of Sri Lankan hoppers and condiments to Indian dosas and breads to Continental breakfast breads and meats, all teamed with the usual fruits,...juices, cereals and yogurts. 

The all-day diner gets really busy in the mornings, but hats off to the staff for managing things so beautifully. We had Dilhara attend on us and he was great, as were some of the others by way of service and attention. 

Great experience overa juices, cereals and yogurts.

The first time I went to Health House, I had a tasteful chicken plate with some good peanut sauce with veggies and...rice. The chicken was juicy and the veggies were made just right. Also the (fresh)juices from this restaurant are very large and thus really worth its price. A big plus was the amount of chicken and veggies, which are in balance with the rice.  

Zimar and the other staff are extremely friendly people who want to give the best experience. I had a chat after my meal with Zimar and have tried the mealplan of the restaurant.
