Amazing choice of world foods. Every genre you can think of is included. The bubbles were amazing and unlimited. Don’t even get me started on the deserts!!...I ate way too many because they were irresistible. I noticed my favourite dessert was not there ( creme brûlée) and after chatting to Kingsley, the executive pastry chef, two fabulous passion fruit creme brûlées appeared at our table like magic!! What service!
I loved the fact that the chefs walk around the tables talking to the guests. A big shout out to Manoj the sous chef and Madara the talented female trainee chef ( u go girl!)

My favorite place is the Harbour  Court. I really like the ambience and the food display arrangements. Both managers Francis and Dilanka are providing a great service...and are very attentive to all the guests. Dilanka is especially excellent and goes beyond limits and serve customers in very personnel way. He knows the requirements of customers and always try his best to fulfill those requirements. This is one of the reason I go there frequently with my friends and family. 

I should also mention the skills of chef Sashi. He is an asset to this restaurant. I always tell him and the managers there he is best chef in Colombo. He too identifies the requirements of customers and do his best to provide an excellent service. Usually before I book a table for dinner I check whether Chef Sashi is available.
