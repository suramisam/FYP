the pasta was absolutely disgusting! it tasted like vomit. I can make better pasta than this. They even messed up the...order for the desert, that wasn't a brownie at all!!!
We could not finish the horrible food and told them to take it away, those stupid idiots packed it for us. 
We are never coming back here because we have our own private chef that makes much MUCH better food. We were being nice and considerate and just wanted to try out the food. We shouldn't have even paid them. 
If you are planning to come here, DON order for the desert, that wasn't a brownie at all!!!

Nevertheless some of the staff moved to other places, the ones which stayed, only to mention Niroshan and some new, very motivated staff members gave as usual their best service, even the restaurant was...stucked with guests.
I got a delicious welcome drink, they really keep in mind, what regular guests favorites are.
The unbeaten quality of their Thai red curry fish with my very special rice ( my idea with pineapple)is the top of all restaurants, where I tried this dish.
Their sweet and sour fish is so so good and fresh.
The round up are the delicious chocolates which they give as a complement..
You will leave the place with satisfaction and the feeling that you have been cared of
for the best.

Go there, you will definitely not be disappoint stucked with guests.
