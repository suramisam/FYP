The Black Mambo and Santeria cocktails were, quite simply, stunning. The presentation was great and the tastes were out of this world.

Why 3* and not 5*?

Lack lustre slow service and a...lazy menu.

If Galle Face is going to impose a mandatory 10% service charge then the service needs to meet both the 4* standard of a hotel and ensure the charge is value.

Problem is with service charges is that staff become accustomed to not having to work for the tip and service standards actually decrease.

This we found to be the case at not just this bar but the Travellers Bar, the Fire Beach and the Verandah.

Whilst they do clearly advise there are excluded taxes and service charges in this bar they do not highlight in percentage terms how much. You'll need to add 30% overall to the printed pricing in their menus.

Everywhere else in Sri Lanka managed to show tax inclusive prices, so you could easily work out if something was  value or not. At menu prices the cocktails were good value add on min  30% for tax and service charges and they were very low value especially in comparison to other  lazy menu.

The food was average, I would rather go to Vanivilas than this place honestly. We went all the way from wattala to Wellawatte Shanmugas for dinner with family, wasn’t worth it. 

No value for money 
No courtesy 
Zero customer service"

Their Thali meals are satisfying lunch treats. The fried baby corn and the naan bread items are good. Don’t forget to drop in to their sweet shop next to the main restaurant, which serves high quality sweets.

However the size of Iddly was extremely small. In my opinion it tantamounts to cheating as 1 piece cost Rs. 120/- with sambar and chutney. A kind of a rip off.

I ordered Aloo Parata from them. If you are a fan of Aloo Parata please avoid this place. There Aloo Parata doesn’t have any aloo and looks...nothing like a Aloo Parata. If you are going there to try it for the first time it will ruin your experience. I once ordered this through delivery but it was not this bad. But now it’s horrible.

On the other side my family ordered Dosa and Vada which actually turned out be tasty and smelled good as well.

Even the Kulfi tasted nice.

The location is good and staff looks friendly as well.
