I last visited Ceyfish as it was called earlier in the 90s. Although the decor has changed and updated, the food was EXCELLENT. The prices are reasonable, the portions are large and the food tasty...and fresh. We ordered 4 main courses each and ended up sharing. I ordered the fish bowl with the roast paan, dhal and pol sambol which was spicy and superb. I ended up feeding everyone roast paan.  Although  one of my family went there to eat hoppers they did not have hoppers that day. If you are gong there with the intention of eating hoppers then you will need to reconfirm this in advance to avoid disappointment. They have a bar as well and an outdoor seating area too. Highly recommended for a dinner and we are definitely going again. Thank you for a superb dining experien and fresh. We ordered 4 main courses each and ended up sharing.

Although most of their choices are limited because of this pandemic but as to what they offer is out of this world. You will never go wrong...with a meal here. It's not so busy as well since of the pandemic.

I still remember Chandana was the first person who served us on our very first visit and then we met Dhammika who are stalwarts of this Restaurant so as to speak. They're are part of the reason we go back to this lovely place in the heart of Colombo, next to the Regal cinema but very quiet homely place with perfect ambiance for family and friends to meet up for any occasion.

Worth every rupee you spent and it's not heavy on your purse.

I hope everyone will visit this lovely place and make memories of seafood like we did.

It surely does give a good run for their worth when compared to upmarket places like Crab Ministry, Crab Factory, Hilton's Black Pepper etc.

We did probably misorder though, finding the 'medium' spiciness of our prawn curry a bit too hot for us, but that was our fault.

The manager Bandara personally...attended to us and made sure that everything is ok. The server Chandana was better than a 5* restaurant service in USA. 

More than anything, the food was to die for. I highly recommend the following 
1) ros pan

4) mutton curry
5) cattle fish curry
6) prawn curry
7) handallo

We arrived at 9 pm on a Tuesday evening. There were 3 other tables; 3, 3, 2, and then us. Well, I wish I could say...how nice it was, but unfortunately, I can not! 
A waiter arrived with a Steak Trolley, he spoke directly and only to my husband about the meat on the trolley, I actually had to STAND up so I could see the meat!! We politely told him, as yet we haven't even seen a menu, so we were unable to choose! Eventually, we received drinks menus, but had to ask 3 times for a food menu! It was all so difficult! 
There wasn't much atmosphere in the restaurant, too many staff but not really achieving anything! There was a live band playing and they were very good. 
We eventually ordered. 
21:25 we received an amuse buche, it was placed on the table and we were told 'amuse buche', we asked what it was, the reply? Amuse buche!! Eventually, we were told Salmon Mousse! we then received bread! We had our starter, which was OK, but needed seasoning. Our mains arrived at 22:15! Crispy Pork Belly was returned as it was bone dry, over-cooked and cold! The mashed potatoes and carrots were also stone cold! Hubby decided against ordering another main, instead opting for cheese! 
On the whole, the entire meal was awful. We wouldn't return and couldn't recommend it. We were not charged for the returned main or the cheese and coffee. The restaurant manager made a point of telling us this and then asked us directly to leave a positive review on TripAdvisor!
All of my reviews are 100% honest and exactly my views.
Our bill was just over 39,000rps, with the exception of the wine, it was not worth  how nice it was, but unfortunately, I can not!

21:25 we received an amuse buche, it was placed on the table and we were told 'amuse buche', we asked what it was, the reply? Amuse buche!! Eventually, we were told Salmon Mousse! we then received bread! We had our starter, which was OK, but needed seasoning. Our mains arrived at 22:15! Crispy Pork Belly was returned as it was bone dry, over-cooked and cold! The mashed potatoes and carrots were also stone cold! Hubby decided against ordering another main, instead opting for cheese! 
On the whole, the entire meal was awful. We wouldn't return and couldn't recommend it. We were not charged for the returned main or the cheese and coffee. The restaurant manager made a point of telling us this and then asked us directly to leave a positive review on TripAdvisor!
All of my reviews are 100% honest and exactly my views.
Our bill was just over 39,000rps, with the exception of the wine, it was not worth it!"

Well lit with light music. Very nice atmosphere and a very good place for a romantic dinner. 

Food: 
We had an appetizer of cheesy mushroom which was a delight and it is a great way to kick off dinner since it was mouth watering...but not too filling.

The Italian food served here is extremely good and of top quality standards. There was a slight mix up with one of the dishes that we ordered but they quickly corrected this very quickly. They also asked and took the correct dish aside so that it was kept warm when both were brought back.  

I had a seafood risotto and this was a beautifully made dish and everything complimented each other extremely well. We also got a vegetarian risotto as well and this again was made extremely well. Even myself who likes a bit of protein in my meal would have been very happy with the dish.  

There is one complaint with the food however, which I hope the management will correct. In the seafood risotto, the crab meat, while extremely tasty was not taken out of the shell. In a fine dining restaurant, trying to dig around and break crab shells to get at the meat is not something I want to do and it is something I expected to have been done in the kitchen. As a result I was only able to enjoy a very little of the crab meat since I couldn't dig out or break out the rest. 

Drinks:
They have a lovely variety of mocktails and  juices... I cannot remember the name but the drinks we had were very nice. 

Desert:
Since it was a birthday, I have called ahead and asked them to set up a cake dish with happy birthday. They brought a special chocolate cake type desert served with a side of ice cream and it was magnificent. 

Staff: 
The wait staff are extremely nice and helpful, they have a good knowledge of the kitchen's menu and what can be made and are very helpful in telling you what is good to eat. 

Conclusion: 
This is a great restaurant especially for special occasions and romantic dinners. The food, except for the small critique was very good and the staff are very help full and always happy to serve y but not too filling.
