As someone who frequently eats Indian food and has experimented with various other Indian restaurants (new and old) in Colombo, I can really say that nothing beats  Navaratna. 

Whatever they make, it's very flavoursome. Our all time favourite...is Dhal Navaratna. No visit is complete without that.  When we are seated, we are greeted by the complementary spicy rasam, then continue to munch on the complementary papadam before deciding to order the mains. Due to the insane variety of vegetarian options available, I always attempt to try at least 1 new dish at this place. Love the paneer sizzling dish as well. Its so juicy and full of spices. I love pairing both of the above dishes with either plain naan or cashew/green pea pulao or even steamed rice. Since they also provide a complementary coriander chutney and curd, the end result is a delight to the senses. 

The service is also quite good. Especially Bandara, who is a very good server. If you want excellent Indian food  this is the place to be.

The restaurant was empty when we arrived and we ordered our food. It took quite a while for the food to be served. Specially the tandoori...chicken, guessing around 45 minutes. After we were done, it took 3 efforts, 3 members of staff and a stern appeal to get some finger bowls to wash the curries off our hands and a very frustrating 15 minutes. 
Even though the food was of great quality the rest was completely unacceptable for a hotel of this standard.
There are other great Indian restaurants in Colombo and I might reconsider coming back, a real sha chicken, guessing around 45 minutes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
My recent visit to The Mango Tree was filled with disappointment and frustration, as the restaurant made multiple mistakes. Here's a breakdown of the issues I encountered:

Hidden Charges and Lack of Transparency:-
The first letdown was...the restaurant's practice of collecting a service charge and an undisclosed government tax. While I understand that service charges are common in some places, customers have the right to know about these additional costs upfront. The fact that the government tax was buried in tiny text at the bottom of the menu is inexcusable. Such practices feel like an attempt to deceive patrons and take advantage of their lack of awareness about the charges.

Suggestion:-
The Mango Tree should clearly display all charges, including government taxes, on the menu in a prominent and easily visible manner. This way, customers can make informed decisions about their expenses before placing an order.
***********************************************************

False Promises :-
when inquiring about the possibility of using the ""koko"" payment option, the staff assured us that they did accept it. However, at the end of the meal, they told us that their koko account was locked, and they couldn't process the payment as promised.

Suggestion:-
It is imperative that the restaurant ensures the availability and functionality of payment options they promote. If a particular payment method is temporarily unavailable, customers must be informed beforehand to avoid any inconveniences or surprises during checkout.
***********************************************************

The combination of these two mistakes made for a highly unpleasant experience at The Mango Tree. As a customer, I expect honesty, transparency, and reliability from any establishment, especially when it comes to financial matters.

I urge The Mango Tree's management to take immediate action to correct these issues and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. By being transparent about charges, displaying them clearly, and ensuring that advertised payment options are functional, the restaurant can rebuild trust and provide a better dining experience for its patrons.

Until these necessary changes are implemented, I cannot recommend The Mango Tree to others, and I will think twice before considering another visit. As a customer, I hope that my feedback will be taken seriously and lead to positive changes in the restaurant's operatio the restaurant's practice of collecting a service charge and an undisclosed government tax.

I had place an order well in advance (5 days before) to delivered by 12pm as it was to be for a group family lunch...however my order was delayed and arrived past 2.15pm.

There was no professionality or responsibility in both the Mango Tree restaurant and its private delivery company as I had informed both parties well in advance about my order, my requirements and my need to have the order in time however neither party paid any attention to my requests. Despite numerous calls and falsely assured that the order will arrive soon, it came past 2.15pm leading to anger and disappointment in the family gathering.  Finally, everyone gave up their expectations to have some Indian cuisine and instead dined on the food ordered from Kingsbury hotel. 

The only postive remark is that the one of the representatives at Mango Tree named Daniel was professional and admitted the mistake and offered the order complimentary for me. Eventhough I appreciated the gesture I paid the delivery person as i felt it was immoral for me to accept a complimentary meal.

I would like to advise caution to everyone else who is planning to order and have the food delivered, as if you are ordering  for a special occasion or event its better to go in person and collect the food. Its better this way rather than staying hungry and waiting for the order to be delivered as neither the Mango Tree restaurant or its private delivery company were responsible enough to atleast inform that there will be a delay or if the customer wished to make an alternative arrangement for the transport in order to ensure the food arrives on time.

I hope that this review will bring about an improvement in the Mango Tree and its private delivery company's delivery methods and professionalism and prevent further problems like this arising in the futu however my order was delayed and arrived past 2.15pm.
