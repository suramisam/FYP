We happened to pass by this restaurant and gave it a try. It‚Äôs a simple place with coconut hut, simple chairs and tables. The menu has a good selection of choices,...but I recommend it‚Äôs best to order rice and curry and nothing else.

There were 2 other tables eating at the restaurant, and I think they came with their drivers or tour guide. They were not local people, so the food served was not spicy. Since I like spicy food, I had to ask them to make it like the local taste.

We came here during lunch, the place was bright but I‚Äôm not sure if I would want to come here for dinner as it might be quite dark and chances are there would be plenty of mosquitos due to open air restaura but I recommend it‚Äôs best to order rice and curry and nothing else.
