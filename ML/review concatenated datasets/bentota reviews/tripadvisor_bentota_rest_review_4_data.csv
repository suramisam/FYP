 Lovely position on an unspoilt empty beach nowhere near the large soulless hotels,with sun loungers and chairs nestled in amongst the trees...and very friendly and attentive staff. I see there are comments criticising the staff but all we saw were members of the public being rude to them because our experience was exactly the opposite.
We only ordered Sri Lankan food as opposed to pizzas etc but they were all good.
I would happily recommend this place to others and will definitely ret and very friendly and attentive staff. I see there are comments criticising the staff but all we saw were members of the public being rude to them because our experience was exactly the opposite.

We really liked the pizza and Chefâ€™s salad. The beachfront has tables and chair settings and lounge chairs close to the ocean. The swimming is great and there is swings and...slides for the kids. Showers  to rinse off with. Spectacular sunset veiw.  DJ Music at night. Great place for weddings and gatherings. Our waiter Ranka made us feel right at home.

It's exactly on the beach. So, a very good option for people who are staying in hotels without any beachside access.
The drinks and salad that we tried were average in terms of presentation, rates and taste.
Aesthetics are...nice.
Lots of Instagrammable photo points.
Huge spa nice.

1)beer not cold at all.

2)takes ages for the food to arrive. (30 mins plus.)

3)Dogs and Spiders wandering near guests.

4) slack waiters and arrogant manager.

5) we asked for food to...be made spicy but it came out non spicy without any flavours.

6)couple of items we ordered were not available and we were only informed about it after 30 mins.

Overall: Very poor customer service. I know Srilanka is know for their hospitality but this was a disaster. Please steer clear from this pl be made spicy but it came out non spicy without any flavours.

You have to wait for glases until your cool drink is geting warm. You dont get forg and knife , to be able to eart. Until you get it, food is cold!...If you order some water you have to drink from the bottle. Glases are not served. If you want to order a Glas, you have to run the whole area to find your waiter,  then you find out, that he is eating. If you insist to be served, he is asking with the full mouth. And so on, and so on....
