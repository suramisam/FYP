Rita and Roshan are a mixed couple from Italy and Sri Lanka who brought their common love for hosting to create a beautiful hotel. You can very clearly see...that they both grew up in families who did that. It's so natural for them that they don't make you feel like just customers but part of their family. 
I will start with their staff who are so kind and professional. They do their job so well. And I have to say this is the first place we have been in, in Sri Lanka, where the staff was treated so well and because of that they do their jobs with such passion. They took care of every single need of ours. They also offered to clean our room everyday. They played and took care of our daughter. They all speak good English and are always present everywhere. I can never thank them enough.

I will now move on to the room and facilities. Our room was very big with everything you might need in including 2 terraces. It was super clean. The bedding was spotless. I have never seen whiter sheets. We had a water boiler with tea and coffee as well as water. There was also a fridge and a safe. The room smelled so nice and had a beautiful view from both sides. The bathroom was also very clean and had hot water and good shower pressure. The hotel itself makes you feel like you are in heaven. Roshan's love for trees and Rita's love for flowers got combined into creating an endless nature feeling. You can enjoy a swim in their pool surrounded with nature like an infinity pool. The pool was always clean. It's big and has an area for the little ones which was very good for our daughter. Their restaurant is also outside near a pond and again surrounded with all the nature. There is also a garden where our daughter could run around safely and happily while we enjoyed the best coffees. 

The food was AMAZING and that is coming from a foodie !!! We never ate anywhere else for our 3 meals everyday ! Tasty food and also generous portions. You have both Sri Lankan and Italian food. We tried both. Both authentic and delicious. Rita brings all the ingredients from Italy and you can taste that right away. And BIG BIG BIG plus for their coffee and cappuccino (obviously also Italian). The first and only place in Sri Lanka where we had such good coffee. 

Now I come to the best part Roshan and Rita ! You see from my review that it feels like I've known them since all my life. I didn't but that's the feeling I have now. They came to talk to us all the time and listened to our personal problems, were very kind and supportive. They are one of the kindest people we have encountered in our lives. They made us feel like their family. This beautiful couple created a magical place. Despite all the difficulties Sri Lankans have gone through their last years, they are still grateful happy people and that's what you will feel in their place happiness, joy and love ! They are both very positive souls and so is their staff. There was not one need or wish we had that they didn't fulfill. They even took us to show our daughter elephants in the evening. They picked us up at our arrival and welcomed us with a welcoming drink, music and introduced their staff to us. Rita and Roshan speak really good English, German, Italian and French. Any places you want to visit, shopping you want to do, they will organize everything for you. 

All in all, this was the best place we have stayed in and not just in Sri Lanka but in all our travels so far. We didn't want to leave at all. So if you don't stay here you are really making a mistake . We recommend it big time  that they both grew up in families who did that.

Rita and Roshan are a mixed couple from Italy and Sri Lanka who brought their common love for hosting to create a beautiful hotel. You can very clearly see...that they both grew up in families who did that. It's so natural for them that they don't make you feel like just customers but part of their family. 
I will start with their staff who are so kind and professional. They do their job so well. And I have to say this is the first place we have been in, in Sri Lanka, where the staff was treated so well and because of that they do their jobs with such passion. They took care of every single need of ours. They also offered to clean our room everyday. They played and took care of our daughter. They all speak good English and are always present everywhere. I can never thank them enough.

I will now move on to the room and facilities. Our room was very big with everything you might need in including 2 terraces. It was super clean. The bedding was spotless. I have never seen whiter sheets. We had a water boiler with tea and coffee as well as water. There was also a fridge and a safe. The room smelled so nice and had a beautiful view from both sides. The bathroom was also very clean and had hot water and good shower pressure. The hotel itself makes you feel like you are in heaven. Roshan's love for trees and Rita's love for flowers got combined into creating an endless nature feeling. You can enjoy a swim in their pool surrounded with nature like an infinity pool. The pool was always clean. It's big and has an area for the little ones which was very good for our daughter. Their restaurant is also outside near a pond and again surrounded with all the nature. There is also a garden where our daughter could run around safely and happily while we enjoyed the best coffees. 

The food was AMAZING and that is coming from a foodie !!! We never ate anywhere else for our 3 meals everyday ! Tasty food and also generous portions. You have both Sri Lankan and Italian food. We tried both. Both authentic and delicious. Rita brings all the ingredients from Italy and you can taste that right away. And BIG BIG BIG plus for their coffee and cappuccino (obviously also Italian). The first and only place in Sri Lanka where we had such good coffee. 

Now I come to the best part Roshan and Rita ! You see from my review that it feels like I've known them since all my life. I didn't but that's the feeling I have now. They came to talk to us all the time and listened to our personal problems, were very kind and supportive. They are one of the kindest people we have encountered in our lives. They made us feel like their family. This beautiful couple created a magical place. Despite all the difficulties Sri Lankans have gone through their last years, they are still grateful happy people and that's what you will feel in their place happiness, joy and love ! They are both very positive souls and so is their staff. There was not one need or wish we had that they didn't fulfill. They even took us to show our daughter elephants in the evening. They picked us up at our arrival and welcomed us with a welcoming drink, music and introduced their staff to us. Rita and Roshan speak really good English, German, Italian and French. Any places you want to visit, shopping you want to do, they will organize everything for you. 

All in all, this was the best place we have stayed in and not just in Sri Lanka but in all our travels so far. We didn't want to leave at all. So if you don't stay here you are really making a mistake . We recommend it big time  that they both grew up in families who did that.
