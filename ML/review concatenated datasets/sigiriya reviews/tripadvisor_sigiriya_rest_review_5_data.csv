One friend of mine took me there and I thinks it's great restaurant in sigiriya. His every food items were very delicious and different taste....  They serve every food item very clean and kneetly....I ordered a different tile of rotti, which was called chocolate roti with honey. It gave me different tast and never I haven't eaten befor. I can remember I had eaten 3 times of that roti. And also all the food items are bit cheaper than other restaurants that I visited. He has a vacation all rental in his own. It is called mango tree and it's very very cheap price to stay if anyone visit around sigiriya. Great job sheyan bro I ordered a different tile of rotti, which was called chocolate roti with honey.

Unfortunately as it was outside of the busy season they didn't have many options available from the menu and ingredients seemed to be missing from what we ordered. 
We had vegetable fried rice and...vegetable crepe along with a coke and 'lassi' that was just shaken up milk as they had no fruit to add. This came to R1500 which is the most expensive street feed we've had after 3 weeks in Sri Lanka. 
The owner was super friendly. Maybe the meals would be better inside seas vegetable crepe along with a coke and 'lassi' that was just shaken up milk as they had no fruit to add. This came to R1500 which is the most expensive street feed we've had after 3 weeks in Sri Lanka.
