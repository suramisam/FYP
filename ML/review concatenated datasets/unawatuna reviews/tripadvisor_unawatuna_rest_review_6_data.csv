Wow, they did not disappoint! The setting is both relaxed & stylish, with beautiful details everywhere you look. We were really impressed with the well curated menu + knowledgeable/ personable...staff. 

The food was sublime. We ate here twice during our stay, as we wanted to try several dishes (all fantastic). The wine choices were also good, and our bottle arrived chilled to perfection. 

A highly recommended experien staff.

Incredible quality food: the dishes were all PERFECTLY balanced, interesting, unusual and exciting. They were multi faceted with unusual elements dotted throughout. The tuna starter was honestly on par...with food Iâ€™ve had at some of the top restaurants in London - as a dish, it was perfect. Hugest complements to the chef, the culinary expertise was absolutely superb. 

The staff were so friendly and attentive, the outdoor setting is beautifully cool with good powerful fans and the whole vibe is just wonderfully chic and relaxed. 

I hope this never gets dragged into â€˜more costlyâ€™ or â€˜less qualityâ€™ territory over time because honestly this place is a true gem.

Iâ€™ve been travelling to Unawatuna every year (except the Covid year) for the last 8 years and Iâ€™ve tried restaurant there is.

The Social used to be based on the beach and I remember it for its excellent prawn burger. However it...has now reinvented itself and moved to a new location. Easily the classiest restaurant in Unawatuna the it exudes quality with an upmarket sophisticated vibe and feel.

Service throughout was excellent with friendly, professional service from a waiter of enormous proportions with an equally large measure of personality.

Above everything the food shines. With a unique and distinctive menu there is something to please everyone. I can highly recommend the octopus, beautifully cooked whilst my friendâ€™s slow cooked pork was equally as good.

The drinks menu is also excellent with an extensive choice.

Overall this is now easily far and away the best resin Unawatuna.
