Absaloutley the best food I have tried in Sri Lanka 🇱🇰!! They do local dishes, Seafood,Steak and many different cuisine!! We tried 90 percent of the menu apart from the fish as I don't like fish!!

Firstly, our host Dileepa was an absolute charm and made us very comfortable. We've had experiences eating in hotel restaurants as outside guests before...that were less than pleasant, but here there is no such discrimination. They gave us a great spot right on the beach, which brings us to our second point: the view. The sun had just set, and the brilliant red skies, the burning torches on the beach and the sight of Galle in the distance made for such a dramatic spectacle. Thirdly then, and most importantly, the food. We had a mixed seafood platter for two, and we have had several of these all over Sri Lanka, and we can safely say it was the best we've had. Fresh, great variety, supremely cooked and great complementary sauces. 
The only minor little detail was that the drinks were a little expensive, and the glass of wine was fairly small for that price. 
Other than that, absolutely loved it. Great experience. Special thanks to Dilee that were less than pleasant, but here there is no such discrimination.

New Year’s Eve we had the sizzling mixed seafood crab.  2 lobsters. Giant king prawns, calamari and a very large red snapper accompanied by rice, chips...and salad it was fantastic.
Cocktails are some of the best we had also they have a team behind the bar so unlike other places drinks arrive very quick .
The restaurant is busy every night so fish is fresh every day.
The owners and staff are lovely but still very professional 
I must make special mention about the young waiter that kept the table clean and ran after us when I left my bag on my chair to find us he was a star.
Hope to return next year and we are considering stopping in there accommodation the food was that goo and salad it was fantastic.
