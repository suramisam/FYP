Vipuln applied the cream for pain and carried him to our room. I could see nothing but his kindness. Shontha reassured...me while I was shocked and did not know how to help my husband. Traveling another country is fascinating but not knowing anyone is also scaring. The kindness I and my husband received here, I hope to pay back to someone who‚Äôs in need in my country or where I live.
Thank you for your kind support.

Went there on friday 1st march. We ordered a drink, cheese toastie, and a sri lankan main meal. It was a quiet evening and apart from us, there was just one other couple dining. 

Our drink and cheese toastie...arrived, then we waited. And waited and waited. After 45min of waiting, we asked the waiter where our food is. He looked surprised, and said we only ordered a drink and toastie! God knows why he didn‚Äôt ask us during the 45min if we wanted anything!

When I reminded him what we ordered he checked and it turns out that he forgot to place the order! Quite the surprise as there was barely anyone else dining. 

There were many ants walking around the floor too. Not sure what all the positive reviews are all abo arrived, then we waited. And waited and waited.
