Overall it’s a fun place for the younger traveller but for a bit more tranquility I’d prefer staying in Dickwella. They have imo a better beach too....Dots bay house has the beach right outside and the big queue for people staying is no doubt the learning to surf operators and beginners waves on Hiriketiya beach. 

No lamp or tv in the room nor basics like tea and coffee really let this place down. 
We arrived also not being told there was a loud party going until 1.30am. But of course on the flip side the live music on the weekend and house party is fun for a younger demographic. 

 We’ve found most of the other places go over and above whereas I found Dots Bay House which was the most expensive place we have stayed to be more concerned with charging the higher prices.  
An example was being served a beautiful egg hopper breakfast but my daughter is young she doesn’t drink coffee and so pay again for juice. Another is being told you will pay for damaging a surfboard but finding it difficult to even borrow one and giving up. 

I’ve rates this average as there is no button between average and very good. It’s more than average.

It's the perfect place for a family with teenagers who like to surf. the beach is just there and it's great for beginners and intermediate surfers. 
It has great atmosphere and it's just super nice place to chill. 

It...has the best food in the area. We tried different dishes and restaurants and Dots just had the best chef, breakfast is amazing. The granola, the french toast, the dots bene eggs, smoothie bowl were our favorites. 

The pizza, the panang curry, burger, taco, salt and pepper calamari , passion fruit tart, everything was so delicious ! The best is though the staff and owner, the people were so nice. i asked the owner for eggplant moju, my favorite sri lankan dish and they made it for me! it was the best moju I have had before, we also booked only for 3 nights and wanted to stay another night, they organized everything. super nice people. can't recommend this place enough.

For starters the fantastic atmosphere! With soft and well spaced area of warm lighting everything is well lit up without the light feeling too direct and creating glare. The high ceilings and great...ventilation paired with strong and silent fans provides great airflow to cool one down and expose the beautiful silhouettes of the palms surrounding. Soft music provides further atmosphere when the fantastic food makes the table silent yet it is never so loud to create difficulty with conversation. To further boast with the food, it is made with great ingredients and the subtle Smokey spiced flavour to the pizzas wood-fired in cinnamon wood adds beautiful notes to all pizzas I’m sure (margarita and Gorgonzola and fungi pizza were the ones I personally tasted and they were unreal) on crispy bases that easily hold the gourmet toppings of the highest quality from both local and imported ingredients.

We went to Rosie's for a cooking class of typical Sri Lankan food (not for Dinner itself). It was amazing. I was one of four family 'cooks', there were two other couples. Eight in all. 
Rosie is a magnificent Sri Lankan...woman who entertained us all and gave a running commentary about the ingredients, how they should be combined and prepared and lots of info about her own story, how life has changed in the country and local area etc.
We cooked 25 dishes from locally sourced foods such as mango, pumpkin, chicken, rice, strange vegetables not seen in the UK and a huge range of spices.
Part of the deal was that each person on the course could have a visitor arrive after the food was prepared and then all would eat afterwards (no charge for that!).
A banquet then ensued. The atmosphere was very friendly with strangers meeting and chatting. We even had a tuk tuk ordered for us on our departure.

Unfortunately for the 50 something parents the techo garage was not quite to our taste, but the 20 somethings loved it and danced the night away. We slipped away after drinks and dinner. 

We did have dinner before and it was really tasty. They could go a bit bigger with the portion sizes (chips for instance) with a little less salt, but great service, fun environment, big functional bar and a brilliant location by the beach."
