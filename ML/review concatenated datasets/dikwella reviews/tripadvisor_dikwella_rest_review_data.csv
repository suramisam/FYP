Also they helped us with tuk-tuk and it was much cheaper that what the guys near the beach asked for the same thing.

The food wasn't delicious and the owner could hardly speak english, she wasn't able to explain any of the unfamiliar dishes from the menu to us. She asked if we want our food spicy...or not, we chose 'not', and it appeared to be tasteless, like they didn't put any spices at all. So it just tasted like a full plate of dough. Our worst food experience in Hiriketi or not, we chose 'not', and it appeared to be tasteless, like they didn't put any spices at all. So it just tasted like a full plate of dough. Our worst food experience in Hiriketiya."
