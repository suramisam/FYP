Hand made and thrown so very thin base. They are also happy to make you a small garlic bread which isnâ€™t on the menu. We went early and it was quite quiet but it starts...to get busy from 7:30pm onwards. A great little place with very reasonable pric to get busy from 7:30pm onwards. A great little place with very reasonable prices.

Pizzas and Calzone were amazing as were the desser surrounded by all the trees, plants and wooden features. Pizzas and Calzone were amazing as were the desserts!"

For starters the fantastic atmosphere! With soft and well spaced area of warm lighting everything is well lit up without the light feeling too direct and creating glare. The high ceilings and great...ventilation paired with strong and silent fans provides great airflow to cool one down and expose the beautiful silhouettes of the palms surrounding. Soft music provides further atmosphere when the fantastic food makes the table silent yet it is never so loud to create difficulty with conversation. To further boast with the food, it is made with great ingredients and the subtle Smokey spiced flavour to the pizzas wood-fired in cinnamon wood adds beautiful notes to all pizzas Iâ€™m sure (margarita and Gorgonzola and fungi pizza were the ones I personally tasted and they were unreal) on crispy bases that easily hold the gourmet toppings of the highest quality from both local and imported ingredients. Lastly but certainly not least the staff were incredibly attentive and pleasant to dine with. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! 

P.S please excuse the photo that does not do this amazing venue justice by any mea ventilation paired with strong and silent fans provides great airflow to cool one down and expose the beautiful silhouettes of the palms surrounding.

I was impressed with the quality, taste and presentation of the food.  
Owner Sudu attaches great importance to the satisfaction of his guests.  He is fluent in German, English, Italian and French...and also offers safari tours to Yala National Park (overnight in tree houses) and we had a wonderful experience there with him.

Great dinner with our  friends.  Gorgeous ambience with super comfy chairs and a lovely view into the treetops  with an ocean vibe. We totally loved  the Bonsai garden around the restaurant and the...subtle lighting. Such a beautiful setting.
  Heriketiya beach is just down the road for a nice stroll after your meal.
We ordered the seafood platter and some pizzas too.  And it was all amazing!! 
Very generous servings and freshly cooked. It was really delicious meal.
 Great salad too. 
We loved the cocktail menu and enjoyed some great cold drinks. 
The service was super friendly and relaxed.
And the music was great for a little dance around after our meal as we prepared to leave. 
The menu is extensive with vegetarian and GF options available.
Other guests around us ordered pizzas and they looked so yummy too.
Coming back to try the locally made curry. It looked and smelled so delici subtle lighting. Such a beautiful setting.

Manager Melanie was blunt at the fact they only serve foreigners,  yet she served us the locals, cause we where the only ones there. She decided to serve us rice and curry and then and...sets the bill as buffet. It was literally day light robbery. Utterly disgusting the way she handled the situation  and no skills in hospitality management, we'd be reporting this place to the tourist board as well. Disgusting 

Recommendation Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã— pathet sets the bill as buffet. It was literally day light robbery. Utterly disgusting the way she handled the situation  and no skills in hospitality management, we'd be reporting this place to the tourist board as well. Disgusting 

Recommendation Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã— pathetic."
