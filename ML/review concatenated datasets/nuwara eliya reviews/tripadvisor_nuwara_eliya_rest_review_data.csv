We were not disappointed!
The restaurant is beautifully designed, has a relaxed vibe and great...atmosphere and is very welcoming. The menu is wide and varied - meats but many vegetarian options, Indian but also Arabic. And it‚Äôs printed as a newspaper with some history attached - quirky and fun!
We dined with vegan friends who were well cared for, with flexibility around the menu options to ensure their satisfaction. We found meals to suit our tastes - tasty, hot, spicy chicken and a gentle butter chicken. Both a delight, as good as it gets. And the naan breads were perfect.
But better than all the food (which couldn‚Äôt be better!) was the service we received from Sudharshini. She was attentive, helpful, always there but never intrusive. A lovely smile and offering great advice.
