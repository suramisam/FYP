Some of them certainly woke the taste buds up with a lovely mouth tingle but not excessive heat, just a nice warming tingle.

It is not my intention to belittle a Sri Lankan business, recovering from our economic crisis, but there's a lot of room for improvement. 

First, this review is...mainly for Sri Lankans, not for expatriates. 

First the food:
In a simple word, not meeting expectations and absolutely no spice (as we call it, hotness üòâ) in the food. The number of options, totally inadequate. There's ONLY chicken and no other protein with 4 vegetarian options and only 1 type of rice. 

All this for a whopping Rs. 2,350 per person!!! Absolute & total RIP OFF! I get a far better rice & curry for less than US $ 7 in Colombo with twice the options. 

Location:
Again, a small room squashed inbetween 2 other shops. Sadly, the rent must be astronomical but usually, these locations are family owned. (Most of the time). They don't offer chilled water bottles but the Manager was kind enough to put ice into two cups so that we could have chilled water. The seating is only for 8 people so a very tight squeeze indeed.

Overall:
An absolute tourist trap! Lot like most of the shops inside the Galle Fort. Catering to tourists. I wasn't sure that they were very welcoming of us locals, even though nothing specific was said, but the facial expressions wasn't welcoming. Maybe I was wrong.

I visited this place, purely on the TA reviews and my wife couldn't stop laughing that we paid nearly Rs. 10,000 for just yellow rice & chicken. 

If you're Sri Lankan, avoid this joint! Leave it to the Tourists. They'll think its rustic and enjoy the fo mainly for Sri Lankans, not for expatriates.

It is not my intention to belittle a Sri Lankan business, recovering from our economic crisis, but there's a lot of room for improvement. 

First, this review is...mainly for Sri Lankans, not for expatriates. 

First the food:
In a simple word, not meeting expectations and absolutely no spice (as we call it, hotness üòâ) in the food. The number of options, totally inadequate. There's ONLY chicken and no other protein with 4 vegetarian options and only 1 type of rice. 

All this for a whopping Rs. 2,350 per person!!! Absolute & total RIP OFF! I get a far better rice & curry for less than US $ 7 in Colombo with twice the options. 

Location:
Again, a small room squashed inbetween 2 other shops. Sadly, the rent must be astronomical but usually, these locations are family owned. (Most of the time). They don't offer chilled water bottles but the Manager was kind enough to put ice into two cups so that we could have chilled water. The seating is only for 8 people so a very tight squeeze indeed.

Overall:
An absolute tourist trap! Lot like most of the shops inside the Galle Fort. Catering to tourists. I wasn't sure that they were very welcoming of us locals, even though nothing specific was said, but the facial expressions wasn't welcoming. Maybe I was wrong.

I visited this place, purely on the TA reviews and my wife couldn't stop laughing that we paid nearly Rs. 10,000 for just yellow rice & chicken. 

If you're Sri Lankan, avoid this joint! Leave it to the Tourists. They'll think its rustic and enjoy the fo mainly for Sri Lankans, not for expatriates.
