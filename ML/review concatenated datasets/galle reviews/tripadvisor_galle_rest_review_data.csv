We popped by earlier in the day to make a reservation - no problem, table booked. 
We returned in the evening to find that the sheet of paper with our...reservation on it had been replaced with a new one and our reservation had been lost which was irritating.
Anyway eventually a table was found. 
The service was nice and the food was nice but it was incredibly rushed. We were in and out within 45 minutes. All perfectly acceptable but no wow fact reservation on it had been replaced with a new one and our reservation had been lost which was irritating.

Having read some ""misinformed""...Reviews and a rather (laughable...upon reflection) ""Positive Review"" from Conde Nast, we opted to eat at Galle Fort whilst in the region!  

Charming building and beautiful setting in the Courtyard...but sadly, the food was very, very disappointing with a real lack of atmosphere that felt like every Diner in there was eating ""their last meal before a firing squad"". Due to a very uninspiring Menu, we ordered the (safe bet of a) Sri Lankan Curry (a dish we have hugely enjoyed a high number of times on our travels over the last few weeks)...my Wife had the Fish Curry and I had the Chicken Curry!  What arrived was various dishes of bland, tasteless slop with none of the depth of flavour that we had come to enjoy so much and become accustomed to each time we had ordered if prior!  The Chef was obviously ""just going through the motions"" as it showed in his lacklustre food....and he was clearly ""daal-ling it in"" ;-)

Don't waste your time as there are a high number of much better places and the sad thing is, if we'd had that dish at the start of the trip then it is highly unlikely we'd had bothered to ever have it again....which would have been criminal.

Ended up coming here to round off every evening.

The owners were delightful and were lovely to talk to, had some great tips on where to go as well.

I...can't say it's the best ice cream in Galle as I didn't go to the others but I can safely say this is some of the best ice-cream I've had outside of Italy!

The flavours were stunning. We did give the menu a really good hit and tried most. 

The stand out flavours for me were:

The spicy. This was like having chai masala in food form. Heaven.
The tamarind. It had a great sour / sharp edge 
The cashew was simply stunning

Half scoops mean you can try lots and mix the flavours. They'll soon tell you if the flavours won't work together.

Very friendly service, stunning ice-cream, great value

Never mind as soon as we got into this lovely little restaurant we were greeted warmly! Service was fast and efficient nice waiters. Took our order for drinks within 5 mins. We ordered our food...straight afterwards, 
My husband wanted the burata and had with his caprese  salad instead of the mozzerella, this was no problem. It was delicious and fresh. I had the diavalo pizza with extra mozerella, it came hot large pizza and well cooked slightly charred on the edges which 
I love !! They have an Italian restaurant 3 doors down and waiter informed us he has an Italian chef so will try. It looked very appealing from the outside when we passed and was very busy! Will try another day. If it‚Äôs as good as his pizza then wow.

What I found strange is that the ground floor with a counter had very loud music and also AC completely on. I didn't hear my boyfriend talking, neither he heard me. With that cool AC, after some time, I felt cold and I wanted to leave as soon as possible. 
When I went to a toilet that is on the 1st floor, I found out that there are 2 floors above the ground floor that also belong to the caf√©, and that these are without AC, since the whole floor are open through balconies.

What I found strange is that the ground floor with a counter had very loud music and also AC completely on. I didn't hear my boyfriend talking, neither he heard me. With that cool AC, after some time, I felt cold and I wanted to leave as soon as possible.
