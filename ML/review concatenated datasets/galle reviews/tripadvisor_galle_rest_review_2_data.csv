Me and my parents were HORRIBLY humiliated here and subject to the worst form of racism where the staff refused to even seat us. Why? Because the staff only seems...to want to entertain white customers! 
We entered the cafe and asked to be seated at a table for 3. A very disgruntled male waiter then went on to point us to a table for 2.  I told him for the second time that we were 3. Again, he pointed me towards a table for 2. Since the cafe was empty and had less than 2 occupied tables, I then pulled up a chair from the table next to ours to help my Dad sit down (my dad had a cast on his leg and was walking with a walking stick).
The second I pulled up the chair, the same waiter practically pushed me out with more hostility than I've ever experienced in my life, asking me in a very loud /raised voice to wait to be seated. (wait for the empty place to get emptier?). He then went on to pick up the chair and bang it on the floor! This too when my Dad was visibly injured. RIDICULOUS.
I'm horrified by how rude this server was....Completely ruined our nig to want to entertain white customers!

Dishes such as 'poll pittu', 'poll rotti', 'kottu' and 'brinjal moju' to name a few. It is like being in their house with mum's home cooking.I visited several times, trying different dishes, all were excellent and good value.The room may be a dark and dingy and there is no outside seating but please do not let that put you off as the welcome and individual service from Rohan makes up.

It is not my intention to belittle a Sri Lankan business, recovering from our economic crisis, but there's a lot of room for improvement. 

First, this review is...mainly for Sri Lankans, not for expatriates. 

First the food:
In a simple word, not meeting expectations and absolutely no spice (as we call it, hotness üòâ) in the food. The number of options, totally inadequate. There's ONLY chicken and no other protein with 4 vegetarian options and only 1 type of rice. 

All this for a whopping Rs. 2,350 per person!!! Absolute & total RIP OFF! I get a far better rice & curry for less than US $ 7 in Colombo with twice the options. 

Location:
Again, a small room squashed inbetween 2 other shops. Sadly, the rent must be astronomical but usually, these locations are family owned. (Most of the time). They don't offer chilled water bottles but the Manager was kind enough to put ice into two cups so that we could have chilled water. The seating is only for 8 people so a very tight squeeze indeed.

Overall:
An absolute tourist trap! Lot like most of the shops inside the Galle Fort. Catering to tourists. I wasn't sure that they were very welcoming of us locals, even though nothing specific was said, but the facial expressions wasn't welcoming. Maybe I was wrong.

I visited this place, purely on the TA reviews and my wife couldn't stop laughing that we paid nearly Rs. 10,000 for just yellow rice & chicken. 

If you're Sri Lankan, avoid this joint! Leave it to the Tourists. They'll think its rustic and enjoy the fo mainly for Sri Lankans, not for expatriates.
