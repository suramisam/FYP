The food is excellent, and there's something on the menu for everyone. Our kids loved...the beach access and splashing in the waves. When they got too hot, the could head inside for a round of table tennis.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

Overall an excellent experience for families, or anyone looking for a chilled out afternoon on the bea the beach access and splashing in the waves. When they got too hot, the could head inside for a round of table tennis.

Got escorted to our table and then were surly forgotten about even though there were lots of staff mulling around on their phone.
Decided to get up and go to the bar...to order drinks after 10 minutes of waiting, which finally got a waiter's attention, who then decided to come and take our order.
Boy, when the food arrived, it was ‚Äúfinger-licking good‚Äù. It was worth the initial wait, especially as the waiter more than made amends for his lapse and the food made the whole occasion worthwhile.
Wonderful setting with good funky music in the background.
Definitely will be coming back in the daytime to feel the vibes and enjoy the food and especially the dri to order drinks after 10 minutes of waiting, which finally got a waiter's attention, who then decided to come and take our order.

It was a good price as well 1500 and the service was great and...the setting on the beach was lovely. But the price of beer let's this place down 650 for a small can 375ml  possibly the most expensive beer we have purchased in Sri Lan the setting on the beach was lovely.
