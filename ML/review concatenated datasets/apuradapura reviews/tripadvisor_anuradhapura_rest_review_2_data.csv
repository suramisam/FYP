Just make sure you have the mosquito repellent handy. 
We opted for one vegetarian set menu and one with fish and were inundated with mango chutney, curries and rice,...including two varieties of aubergine, water spinach, dhal, cabbage and cucumber. Everything was extremely tasty. With two bottles of water, we got change out of LKR2500. Ridiculously good value, especially given the setting and the quality of food. Just a pity that we couldn’t taste their famed jackfruit curry, but the fruit isn’t in season in August.

Ordered two continental breakfasts, pancake and sandwiches. 

The waiter said the juice was only mango when we asked (due to allergies), it was mixed fruit. So not a place for allergic people! 

Pancakes had a caterpillar in it!! 

Omelette...was a lot of onion and weird looking bacon. 

Tomato sandwich was ok. 

Cozy garden how ever, but many mosquitos! 

Overpriced! Paid 3700rp.
