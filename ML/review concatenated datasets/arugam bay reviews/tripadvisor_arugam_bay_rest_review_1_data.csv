Avocado salad - a lot of big pieces of onion. Bad peeled onion.
Beef burger...- it's impossible to eat that cutlet.  Disgusting taste and smell.
Chicken salad - chicken is overcooked. Impossible to eat.

We've been surprised this difference of reviews and reality and we managed to find review that the owner is subsequently looking in the city for those who leave bad reviews and make scandals, forcing them to be removed.
Judging by the number of questions about our stay, this seems to be true.

Karma Gardens is run by a pair of down-to-earth Australian brothers (Matt and Brad), both vegans themselves so everything on the menu has been with genuine thought and love. 

The cafe is a 5-10 minute walk...from the main stretch in Arugam, surrounded by grassy fields and a large, flowery garden.

It's peaceful enough to get some work done (great free WiFi) or have a long conversation with a friend over food and drinks. 

They offer a range of smoothie bowls, toasts / rottis, burgers, filling salads, as well as freshly made juices, coffees and teas, etc. 

I'd recommend trying their weekend-special Seitan burgers, or the Kurrukan Rotis (with avo or bruschetta), and their Tumeric latte. All the smoothie bowl combos are delicious, too.  from the main stretch in Arugam, surrounded by grassy fields and a large, flowery garden.

The pizzas there are great. Freshly prepared and generously topped. They tasted...great to us. A clear recommendation. 

It was also nice that we were given a card game after ordering, which we could use to shorten our waiting time.
