We first visited hello burger in 2018 in Hikka. Australians know and love a good burger and the burgers these guys whip up are some of the best I‚Äôve ever had. We couldn‚Äôt wait to come to a bay and get our hands on...a smiley burger. I was vegetarian last time so it was awesome to try their meat burgers too.
When we arrived in a bay I was a bit unwell and wasn‚Äôt up for the walk from the accommodation and we got a really easy delivery via WhatsApp. We ate here 3 times in our 3 wee a smiley burger. I was vegetarian last time so it was awesome to try their meat burgers too.

We had the chicken burger and chilly burger 

The chilly burger was a perfect medium rare. And looked like 220g just as advertised.
Chicken burger was juicy and delicious.
The prices very very reasonable  and the portion was quite...big.

The staff was very attentive especially the owners, even though there  were some tourists in the restaurant they gave us good service, which is very nice as usually locals  get sub par service in tourist areas. 

The restaurant is highly recommend big.
