For lunch, I ordered a tuna salad and the grilled prawns which were absolutely delicious and satiating. ü¶ê 
After that I had a local green tea.

For drinking, I had a lemon...juice with no added sugar (caution: it‚Äòs pretty sour! üòÑ). 

Everyone from the staff was very friendly and service was perfectly timed. üôè

Only thing I didn‚Äòt like too much was the music which had a slightly strong bass‚Ä¶ but that‚Äòs because I‚Äòm more a calm person and like to enjoy the serenity of the beach. üåä

Not far past the kushtarajagala statue, there's a signposted turn up a steep hill (400 m) and there he is. We took a bit of...a chance and were glad we did. 
Chef and his family were warm but professional. The food was delicious. I had the  soup, and we shared a veg curry with all the trimmings. Even the side salad was gorgeous. 

He had a successful restaurant that sadly was destroyed- but he's not given up, and the man is as inspirational as his food is delicious. 

My only regret is we didn't go earlier. The other patrons while we were there were repeat customers- as would we have been!

I hope Chef Akila can rebuild his restaurant. But til then- do go and check him out. And don't forget to order the chips while you're waiting. a chance and were glad we did.
