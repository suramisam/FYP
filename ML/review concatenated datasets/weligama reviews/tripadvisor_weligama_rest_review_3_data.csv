We ordered salads hummus and several main course, all came late and first came the main course . The chicken was overcooked with tones of herbs. The hummus was watery...and miled . You could buy hummus in a supermarket which is much better than that. We ordered fajita , in the menu it said it come on a pita, but end up coming as a sandwich a very bad one .
Salad was salty and not fresh. 
Overall the place is not clean service is bad food is poor I wouldn't recommend ot AT A and miled . You could buy hummus in a supermarket which is much better than that. We ordered fajita , in the menu it said it come on a pita, but end up coming as a sandwich a very bad one .
