Therefore my friend and I decided to sample the 7 course Christmas Dinner on Christmas Eve...and it was absolutely wonderful! 

They have set up the tables at quite a distance from each other,  so that it  felt safe to dine there and we chose outdoor seating, although some diners favoured the tables inside. The set menu was very well thought out and offered so many dishes and tidbits that expats hanker after in Sri Lanka.  There was no vegetarian option, which might be something to introduce for future set dinners, but I am definitely looking forward to the next festive occasion!  The portions were just right and the timing of the menu was impeccable, making for a very enjoyable 3 hours of fine dining. 
The antipasto platter was a delight, followed by a sumptuous salad with smoked salmon, quail eggs, apples and walnuts.  The third course was a very tasty turkey and rosemary skewer, with a delicious and rich sweet potato and butternut squash soup. 
As a palate cleanser they offered a very christmassy and refreshing cranberry sorbet, before the main course, which was a choice of lamb with asparagus and mint sauce or Herb crusted sea bass.  Both were very moreish indeed.   The main dish was followed by 2 courses of dessert, much to our delight, as we both have a rather pronounced sweet tooth: a season.appropriate gingerbread souffle with apple sorbet and petit fours with chocolates.  
It really was fine dining at its best and gave any high-end European restaurant a run for its money. I will definitely be coming back to True Blue for breakfasts, lunches  and dinners and  - course - for sundowners in the rooftop bar.
True Blue really is a marvellous addition to the culinary landscape in Hikkadu and it was absolutely wonderful!

In essence there's a rice and 2x veg curry that you can then add other curries to.

We had the main plus fish curry and another plus egg curry. Both with the recommended red (brown) rice.

We were both...asked how spicy and I said medium. The heat was missing, I think I should have gone spicier - however that said there was an amazing amount of flavour in the fish curry

A huge pot of tea and a mango lassi

Bill tonight was just 5000LKR, Not only was the food amazing or have incredible value as well.

This is a little off the beaten track but well worth the 2 mins walk from the main drag.

It was good, but really tourist versions, no spicy at all even eating different curries and asking...for spicy. Service quite slow and not really interested people working there, expect 45min to an hour for food (which I don't mind since that normally means that food is properly cooked).

But the beach at this spot is the best in Hikkaduwa, the small dead reef here acts as a wave breaker so it's really calm water here, perfect for children.

You just need to let her know in advance you will be coming in the evening so she can shop for and prepare all the ingredients and nothing goes to waste.
With Sri Lankan 'rice and curry' you order your main dish and then also receive different accompanying vegetable dishes & rice.

It‚Äôs a beautiful clean quite upmarket restaurant with a peaceful ambience, nicely laid out next to floodlit swimming pool. The staff were friendly & courteous.
My husband & I had Full fish, he chose chips & salad, I opted for mashed...potato & salad. There wasn‚Äôt a choice of fish, so we both had Para fish which was very tasty & nicely cooked. Delicious mash!  Small portion of chips . 
Our friends had Tuna steak & Seer fish, both of which I thought were rather small pieces for 1750 rs. The Seer fish was rather overdone & dry, the tuna nice apparently.  Again, too small a portion of chips so we had to order extra!
It‚Äôs certainly on the pricier side for Hikkaduwa and unfortunately no alcohol licence, the meal did lack a chilled glass of white wine!
Overall, an enjoyable meal, would probably retu potato & salad. There wasn‚Äôt a choice of fish, so we both had Para fish which was very tasty & nicely cooked. Delicious mash!  Small portion of chips .

Large selection of drinks.
Good coffee which is important.
To be mentioned - cleanliness in the restrooms, eco-friendly dishes (from coconuts), live band on Wed and Sundays with a good music.  By the way, we have seen several times that people celebrate birthdays, which is also an indicator.
Service sometimes slows down a little during rush hours, as everywhere else, but it is not critical.

Tried fish and chips and it was really tasty, also a really big portion - I suggest to share it with your partner :) the same goes...to avocado toast. 
All the food going to the tables looked really tasty and all the portions were pretty big - worth the money.
