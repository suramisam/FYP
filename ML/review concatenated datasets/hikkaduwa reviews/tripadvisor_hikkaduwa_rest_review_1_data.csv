We had a really flavorful Sri Lankan rice & curry: pumpkin curry, dhal curry, fried eggplant, coconut sambal and mango chutney with rice and papadam. Great value for money. We also tried our first wood apple juice. The chef mixed the fruit with coconut milk, vanilla and sugar. An extraordinary taste!

We were staying at the Residence and asked for a name of a good restaurant. Straight away we were told about Canal View. This was good as it was already on...my list. We reserved a table for the next night (make sure you book) and off we went. We walked as we weren't far away. I'm glad that we had google maps as this place is out of the way! Once we arrived we were made welcome and shown to our table... I think there are only 5 or 6 tables hence the need to book! The setting is fantastic, you are literally in someone's front garden!
When you order they start to make the food. Nothing is pre-cooked, everything is made fresh. Don't be surprised if you have to wait a while for your food to arrive!

The Sri Lankan curry was the best food I've ever tasted! My taste Buds were all over the place! I asked for the chicken curry (spicy), you get a large bowl of rice surrounded by different curry's. So I got the Chicken, potato, carrot,  green bean and egg plant. It was all absolutely amazing.

Two nights later we were back, with 4 friends. They also agreed that the food was fantastic and we all had another great night. The banana fritters went down a treat!

Sadly all good things come to an end it was getting close to going home, however we still had another night and there was only one place we were going to eat! Our third visit in a week! We were made to feel like family from the moment we arrived. At the end of the evening we met all the family. We couldn't thank them enough!

We were staying at the Residence and asked for a name of a good restaurant. Straight away we were told about Canal View. This was good as it was already on...my list. We reserved a table for the next night (make sure you book) and off we went. We walked as we weren't far away. I'm glad that we had google maps as this place is out of the way! Once we arrived we were made welcome and shown to our table... I think there are only 5 or 6 tables hence the need to book! The setting is fantastic, you are literally in someone's front garden!
When you order they start to make the food. Nothing is pre-cooked, everything is made fresh. Don't be surprised if you have to wait a while for your food to arrive!

The Sri Lankan curry was the best food I've ever tasted! My taste Buds were all over the place! I asked for the chicken curry (spicy), you get a large bowl of rice surrounded by different curry's. So I got the Chicken, potato, carrot,  green bean and egg plant. It was all absolutely amazing.

Two nights later we were back, with 4 friends. They also agreed that the food was fantastic and we all had another great night. The banana fritters went down a treat!

Sadly all good things come to an end it was getting close to going home, however we still had another night and there was only one place we were going to eat! Our third visit in a week! We were made to feel like family from the moment we arrived. At the end of the evening we met all the family. We couldn't thank them enough!

It can be hard to find the way there so I recommend getting a Tuktuk and having the directions on your phone open. But it is so worth it! A...little secluded oasis with amazing food and service. The wait time is a little long, but that’s how you know they cook the food to order and what you get served is proper authentic. We were recommended this place by some locals and the prices were great as well! Would recommend to everyone in Hikkaduw little secluded oasis with amazing food and service.

Be prepared that it's a little off the beaten track (about 5 mins...from the main road in hikkaduwa), plus it's limited to 7 tables, so it may be worth booking in advance. Although we turned up and waited 30 mins and managed to grab a table.

I grew up in SL and know my Sri Lankan food and this was spectacular!!
Fresh ingredients that arrived as we were there and cooked fresh! Separate for me and my husband as...we wanted different spice levels!
When we asked for fruit salad we heard them chopping it fresh and it was amazing! 
Great value for money too and the best was the personal touch from all the family!
