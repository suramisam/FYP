We went to The Lounge, while sitting there, the curly hair boss was screaming and giving his employer the biggest smack on the poor guys cheek.
It was very violent and we were chocked. We could not get out of there, fast enough....We felt so bad for the poor employee.

Spacious, with comfortable seats, with a huge swing overlooking the ocean and small ones by the bar. The food is delicious, fresh, prepared on the spot. There were 10 us and every dish was absolutely amazing. The tuna from...the starter and mango salasa took me to ciusine paradise. Music just make you dance. And the Owner: he makes everything the place is exceptional for the ambience, gives you personal touch, tries to have a small talk with everyone and makes you feel more than just a plain client. There is a 3%surcharge for using a card.

Me and my girlfriend didnâ€™t enjoy the food in Sri Lanka but The Lounge was the first time we had a good meal. The owner is a bit of a...loose cannon as you can see from the reviews but if you want a good meal by the beach, you have to come here. Another recommendation not just for the Lounge, but all bars in Sri Lanka would be to install a good quality dartboard with real darts.

As we walked along the beach from our accommodation, we werenâ€™t overly impressed with the options available for dinner. We then spoke to someone who recommended the Lounge and we were delighted that we followed their advice!...You get a barge across the water with nice views and awesome beach-bar atmosphere.

It was a Friday night so we got to see a traditional dance and fire show which was awesome, and had the seafood pasta and some delicious cocktails!

Super friendly owner Gihan and great chef and staff. The menu is imaginative and a welcome twist on local cuisine. If youâ€™re around Friday night thereâ€™s a party with Sri Lankan dancers.

The sad thing is it was the best food we have had on our trip in Sri Lanka and I wanted to leave an amazing review....When we went to pay he said there is a 3% surcharge for using a card.

I asked why he didn't tell us before - his response was this is standard for Sri Lanka. I told him in 2 weeks of being here we have NEVER been asked to pay a surcharge. 

He wanted cash (in my experience people who want cash do so to avoid tax) and claimed his machine wasn't working.  It was working fine but if it wasn't shouldn't he have told us from the beginning?).

He then threw the cards at us and said 'if you don't want to pay you won't leave here. If you want trouble I will give you trouble-.

 This is a clear threat of violence and in the UK would constitute a criminal offence). We were NOT not going to pay, we were chatting quite normally (the owner had been very chatty with us when we arrived) so I was shocked he threatened us.

It is owned by an extremely loveable gentleman who was beyond accomodating and ensured that me and my friends enjoyed our night.

And if youâ€™re wanting to eat some high...quality fresh seafood, just go here and simply ask for the tuna sashimi. You will struggle to find anything as good!
