We felt incredibly lucky to find this fabulous spot. 

Oshan who is the chef at the lobster pot saw us loitering on the beach and offered to show...us a safe path into the cove as there are a lot of urchins . He was then kind enough to guide us around this magical underwater paradise - full of coral and many variety of tropical fish . 

We snorkelled for over an hour with him , but when we came back to shore and I offered him some money for helping us, he wouldn't accept it. Instead we sat in the lobster pot and drank beer for a while as we built up an appetite. 

We were then able to pick a fish directly from the fishermen (a beautiful red mullet) Oshan was then really happy to have me in the kitchen to watch as he prepared us this delicious meal along with a lovely pineapple coleslaw - absolutely beautiful food- and equally beautiful people who run the place. 

It's a humble affair- but if you like the natural beauty of the ocean and the even more beautiful atmosphere of these lovely people - you are in for a treat!!! 

Our only regret was not being able to stay longer as we left the area the next day.

The prices were surprisingly high but we thought that the quality of the fresh fish will convince us. But this was not the case. The fish tasted very weird, like chlor and the tiger prawns only looked big and there was only very little meet inside. The prawns were good. The most disappointing thing were the side dishes, which was only vegetable rice, which had a very strong plastic taste.
