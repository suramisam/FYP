great host
nice location
the food was nice

we would have liked to have learned about some breads or poppadoms. We did a rural village cookery class the day prior which was better for us - nicer tasting food, more variety and much...cheaper.

i would still recommend it at 4.5 stars, we enjoyed the food and the experien cheaper.

The cooking experience is amazing and you can learn a lot, prepare different local dishes and the way they are cooked. Of course, all the things cooked are available for consumption. We were lucky...to enjoy a candlelight dinner with no other guests. 

Also to stay overnight... the garden overlooking the river is so beautiful and cozy! Unfortunately, our program was very tightly scheduled, so we did not have the opportunity to stay .... but it must be good ;) the atmosphere is very friendly and familiar. 

It is definitely worth a visit! Thanks again for letting us be a part of it. ü´∂

Our first stop was a local market, where we were able...to browse around and pick up the ingredients for our cooking class. We were familiar with all the spices, but it was interesting to learn about vegetables that aren't very common outside of Sri Lanka. You don't have to pay for anything during the shopping experience since everything is included in the price paid beforehand.

Following that, you are taken to their home, which also has guest rooms. It overlooks the Mahaweli River and is surrounded by natural scenery.

First, Sulochana gives you a thorough overview of Sri Lankan spices and how to make the main spice mixes you'll need to prepare the dishes we'll prepare later. She then introduces the ingredients (vegetables and chicken) and how to marinate them. Each person will prepare the food in turn, while one will write down the steps.

She uses a wood-fired hearth, so everything is so authentic! She is very patient with you, walks you through every step in making each dish, and answers any questions you have about Sri Lankan food.

As you enjoy the food you prepared, you feel proud of yourself!

I love spicy food, so Sulochana challenged me with their local chili, which I really enjoyed!

Friendly talked over the phone and made a lunch reservation for 12th February 2024.
My wife & myself just...walked around 01.30pm Senani By Oak Ray Restaurant, because I've been in this chain hotels & restaurants,especially Liyya Water Villas Dambulla. But when we arrive at the restaurant the gentleman sitting at the entrance said rudely the 01st floor was fully booked and no tables at all. I informed I have already booked a table and I need to order my lunch because we selected this place for our anniversary celebration. Someone said go to the next floor next floor like that. On the upper floor there was a table for 02 guests but Rohan the manager who was there talked to foreign guests and asked them to sit there and both of us rejected and he said please have a sit on the sofa and when we free with one table we can offer you a table. I don't want to have my lunch at Rohan's time, If I need to take my lunch at that time I need to do that on time. 
For Management- Please train your employees very professionally and with disciplines because if they act like this it's not good for your future.
Really disappointed regarding Rohan's customer service and also his buddies. I understood one thing, they are welcoming only for their Foreign customers and don't care about Sri Lankan Customers.
Hotels or restaurants or any service industry management should pay their attention to customer service / reservations  and also both resident guests and non-resident guests.

Fresh line...soda was spot on and really refreshing.

The chai masala was the worst I've had, ever, though.

The tea was way way too strong and overpowered the small amount of masala spices they used. This was definitely powder not fresh spices.

 At 550LKR a cup I had expected something better or at least to equal to the 350LKR I've had elsewhere.

nice location
the food was nice

we would have liked to have learned about some breads or poppadoms. We did a rural village cookery class the day prior which was better for us - nicer tasting food, more variety and much...cheaper.

i would still recommend it at 4.5 stars, we enjoyed the food and the experien cheaper.

Our first stop was a local market, where we were able...to browse around and pick up the ingredients for our cooking class. We were familiar with all the spices, but it was interesting to learn about vegetables that aren't very common outside of Sri Lanka. You don't have to pay for anything during the shopping experience since everything is included in the price paid beforehand.

Following that, you are taken to their home, which also has guest rooms. It overlooks the Mahaweli River and is surrounded by natural scenery.

First, Sulochana gives you a thorough overview of Sri Lankan spices and how to make the main spice mixes you'll need to prepare the dishes we'll prepare later. She then introduces the ingredients (vegetables and chicken) and how to marinate them. Each person will prepare the food in turn, while one will write down the steps.

She uses a wood-fired hearth, so everything is so authentic! She is very patient with you, walks you through every step in making each dish, and answers any questions you have about Sri Lankan food.

As you enjoy the food you prepared, you feel proud of yourself!

I love spicy food, so Sulochana challenged me with their local chili, which I really enjoyed!

The chai masala was the worst I've had, ever, though.

The tea was way way too strong and overpowered the small amount of masala spices they used. This was definitely powder not fresh spices.

The chai masala was the worst I've had, ever, though.

served with paratha bread and cucumber raita.  Ordered soft drinks too.

Our waiter knew little English. The menu is very long, many dishes so it hard to choose and guess what they are good at. Eventually the Chinese dish was good, the pasta not good and overcooked, nice...vi view."

In the end we went for the jackfruit burger and the Mediterranean wrap which we shared. All washed down with a Lion and Mango cocktail.  Only slight complaint - server was overwhelmed...(such is the popularity of the place) and so service was a little slow. But certainly worth any wait as is the quality of the food. Also the music was a bit basy and loud at one point (but suspect the majority of the (younger) clientele would have no complai (such is the popularity of the place) and so service was a little slow.

The menu is mouthwatering and the food did not disappoint. We had the smoothie bowl, the jackfruit wrap and the biriyani. It...was all super tasty and fresh. 

The staff are lovely and really kindly agreed to our pre order for breakfast the next day, even though we had to pick it up before they opened as we were jumping on the Ella train. 

We ordered smoothie bowls and wraps for our breakfast and lunch as well as coffees and were grateful for the amazing food on our long train journey.

Would highly recommend and will return when we are back again. Thank you Soul Food te was all super tasty and fresh.
