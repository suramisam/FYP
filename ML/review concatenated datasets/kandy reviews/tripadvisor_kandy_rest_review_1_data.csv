I fancied a change from Sri Lankan curries so I ordered the prawn cocktail which was far more high-quality than one normally receives in England.

The downside was that we had to arrange for a ride back at higher rates. The manager helped us to secure a ride back, which was a great help. Therefore we were able to relax and look around and drink in the lovely view.
The place was really beautiful, the view of the town, though nighttime was magical. I did wish we could hv gone during the day! 
The dining area had a lovely ambience. And the menu was available on the site, so we could order quickly. There was lovely music playing softly which added to the ambience.
For dinner we ordered, the  Hot butter Cuttlefish, served with onion garlic rice,  Grilled Chicken  with bbq sauce served with mash potato and boiled vegetables, and chicken onion masala
served with paratha bread and cucumber raita.  Ordered soft drinks too. 
 We enjoyed the flavourful dishes very much, but would hv liked it if the grilled Chicken was more succulent.

great host
nice location
the food was nice

we would have liked to have learned about some breads or poppadoms. We did a rural village cookery class the day prior which was better for us - nicer tasting food, more variety and much...cheaper.

i would still recommend it at 4.5 stars, we enjoyed the food and the experien cheaper.

The cooking experience is amazing and you can learn a lot, prepare different local dishes and the way they are cooked. Of course, all the things cooked are available for consumption. We were lucky...to enjoy a candlelight dinner with no other guests. 

Also to stay overnight... the garden overlooking the river is so beautiful and cozy! Unfortunately, our program was very tightly scheduled, so we did not have the opportunity to stay .... but it must be good ;) the atmosphere is very friendly and familiar. 

It is definitely worth a visit! Thanks again for letting us be a part of it. ü´∂

It started with a warm welcome and some delicious ice tea, before making our way to the beautiful outdoor kitchen area,...replete with a traditional wood-burning oven and authentic clay pots. 

Sulochana proceeded to talk us through the various spices and ingredients, when to use which types of spices with different produce, how to make our own coconut water and cream, and much more. 

Over the next two hours, we learnt how to make - with the expert guidance and tutelage of Sulochana - a variety of curries and dishes, all of which were absolutely delicious! 

We had so much fun and laughter that two hours whizzed by. We left with full tummies and plenty of happy new memories. Even my wife - who has often been indifferent to cooking - absolutely loved it!

Our first stop was a local market, where we were able...to browse around and pick up the ingredients for our cooking class. We were familiar with all the spices, but it was interesting to learn about vegetables that aren't very common outside of Sri Lanka. You don't have to pay for anything during the shopping experience since everything is included in the price paid beforehand.

Following that, you are taken to their home, which also has guest rooms. It overlooks the Mahaweli River and is surrounded by natural scenery.

First, Sulochana gives you a thorough overview of Sri Lankan spices and how to make the main spice mixes you'll need to prepare the dishes we'll prepare later. She then introduces the ingredients (vegetables and chicken) and how to marinate them. Each person will prepare the food in turn, while one will write down the steps.

She uses a wood-fired hearth, so everything is so authentic! She is very patient with you, walks you through every step in making each dish, and answers any questions you have about Sri Lankan food.

As you enjoy the food you prepared, you feel proud of yourself!

I love spicy food, so Sulochana challenged me with their local chili, which I really enjoyed!

It was a wonderful experience. We learned so much about the culture and food of Sri Lanka.
