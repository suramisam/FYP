Can sit outside overlooking a river and nice greenery.  Food and service was very good and plentiful and prices very good too.  Went back for dinner.

It is a local authentic family run restaurant. We were served by a very friendly gentleman. We ordered spring rolls, chicken curry & fish curry lots of veg dishes accompanied the meal, plus rice &...naan bread. We did ask for it to be made less spice & everything was delicious ! We sat on the balcony with lovely views of the water. We also saw the fruit bars flying by as they flew from the botanical gardens. Not a sight you see every day. We also had Beers, gins & water. Such good value for  money ! The total bill was less than £20. Owner ordered us a tuk tuk to take us back to our hotel. Thoroughly enjoyable meal & experien naan bread.

Delicious food. Nice setting, next to a river with palmtrees. According to waiter, every night around 18h00 - 18h30 passing of thousands of bats above the river. They leave the botanical garden in search of fruits in the jungle. Unique experience!"

All tasted very good. Also the fresh pineapple juice was excellent. 
The staff pointed us out to a chameleon hiding in the palm tree. Superb spot on the side of the river."

We loved the view of the river. Ambience was good too. Food was catered to zero spice on our request. We had a chicken grill, fish curry and rice. The veg dishes accompanying...the fish meal were delicious. We loved how simple veggies were prepared in varying tastes, brinjals to cabbage to pumkins. Sorry we were so hungry that I forgot to get pictures on both occasions. Good prices too (bill attached). The lion beer lager on Day 1 was a let down, but that must be just me cuz I like my beer strong :) 

Only downside was perhaps the ceiling fans that didnt work on high speed, and it was a warm few days that we the fish meal were delicious.

But we had a nice evening, fried rice is good and fresh juices. A good place to eat if you are staying locally."

Stunning views onto the river with big open windows and doors which is the highlight of this lovely spot. Food was excellent and empty plates all around. I had the club Sandwich,...my husband had the seafood noodles and my mother in law the seafood rice. All recommended. They also have beer and a good variety of soft drinks/ fruit juices etc. Service was so attentive and they were friendly from the start to finish of our visit and they sorted a tuk tuk to return to our hotel. We are sad our hotel is on the other side of Kandy otherwise would have returned for dinner another day.
