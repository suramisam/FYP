Ambience is definitely needs improvements, so does the hygiene. Veg buffet was good. Non veg dish ordered was too spicy and not edible. Price too high too. The online reviews are misleading...as the place is over rat as the place is over rated."

Then of course, who is to judge the Beach Bar on a simple subjective impression? Maybe they were having a bad day, that's all.
However, we genuinely felt like we were bothering them when we politely ordered 4 fresh...juices. But then, maybe they had just finished cleaning the juicer, that's all.

After a while, our juices finally arrived! Oh we couldn't wait to get a taste of...the wrong fruits. Not only had they mixed up the order but it also felt like they had diluted each one with water. Fine fine fine, maybe we hadn't been clear enough when ordering—although we'd repeated the full order 3 times, just to be sure. Moreover, when I pointed out that they had juiced the wrong fruits, the waiter just looked straight at me in disbelief; to which I awkwardly replied with a quick ""Nevermind, this will do just fine"".

When they charged us the usual 10% service charge I couldn't help but tell them we weren't paying it due to extremely poor service. The waiter reported this to the manager, who immediately brushed him off with a condescending hand gesture. Obviously, they didn't bring the according change in regards to my request. We left.

It is very well located thou juices. But then, maybe they had just finished cleaning the juicer, that's all.
