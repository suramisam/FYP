Being someone that eats rice three times a day and being a huge foodie, I am extra critical about my food especially the rice based meals! My Chicken Lamprais today was just...off the charts and probably the best I've had!!

Firstly, it arrived in under 35 minutes, hot as ever almost as if it had just been cooked and sent to me right away. Secondly, there were so many different items offered with the rice which were so unique in preparation and flavour! A taste I've never experienced before! Thirdly, the portion was huge! I usually eat a lot and finish a big packet of rice all by myself but I struggled to finish this one as they were so generous with the quantity! Too generous!

I would give their Chicken Lamprais a 10/10 without batting an eyelid because it is every foodie's dream! Especially if you love rice! Thank you again Roo's Deli for giving me one of the most satisfying meals I have had in a while!! Definitely going to be one of your loyal customers and looking forward to ordering from you again very so off the charts and probably the best I've had!!

But don't just go for the cold brew... or to savour...your favourite spirits that you'd like to take with you. Go through their menu and you'll find quite a variety to sink your teeth into, or to satisfy your cravings for a nice and spicy 'bite'. If you're Sri Lankan, you know how important 'bites' are, and the immeasurable role it plays in complementing our drinking :-)... If you are one of those bite-people, Jo Jo's is the place on the beach... (I mean if you really know and love your bites).

It's not to say that their choice of mains (if I may call it so) are poor, they are a league of their own. We all know what a good Chinese-Sri Lankan style Chop Suey is... these guys have gone one step further and given it a more flavourful spin (at least that is what 'Z' (Z is one of the partners... who knows his food) told me one evening. I do agree that they've added a little magic of their own, to this ever-popular Chinese 'rice'. But that's not all. They've got more. 

The good thing is, when you give your order, tell one of the boya taking the order how you want your spice and they'll do the best with your request. The batter fried stuff are quite crunchy and they spicy stuff are just fiery in a kind of tantalising way. 

By the way, it doesn't mean Jo Jo's is only for the guys & gals who want to sip a brew or down a few shots. It's also a charming setting, to just go out for a chilled out dinner with someone close or your family. 

Next time you hit Mount beach, not visiting Jo Jo's would be such a was your favourite spirits that you'd like to take with you.

JoJo‚Äôs is typical of these, pleasant enough but nothing to get excited about. All these places have identikit menus, the usual fish, chicken,...beef and squid dishes for around 700LKR. Some of them then ramp up the cost by charging up to 450 for a portion of steamed rice, all have sky-high beer prices (often not listed on the menu) and all add 10%, so the final bill can turn out a bit more than you were expecting.

At Jojo‚Äôs the food is OK, the generous portion of rice moderately priced and the beer as overpriced as everywhere else. In the evening they ruin the tranquil atmosphere, sound of waves, etc. by playing a local radio station at high volume so you get random music or, half the time, someone talking. Service was pretty quick when I was there, but I was the only diner ‚Äì there seems a general lack of punters in this area nowadays.

I wouldn‚Äôt particularly recommend eating on Lavinia Beach at all, but if you want to, JoJos is as good as the various more expensive places listed on TA. If you can't find somewhere quieter, it‚Äôs not a bad choice. If you can, the quality will likely be about the sam beef and squid dishes for around 700LKR.

The closest restaurant was packed and we walked few more meters...and located Jo Jo‚Äôs bar/restaurant. It was also full, but the nice waiters brought a table and chairs for us to be very close to water.

It was the full moon and the moonlit beach and festive atmosphere‚Äîfamilies frolicking in water and occasional fireworks flying over the ocean‚Äîmade it a very special evening. 
Humorously, they did not serve beer because full moon was a religious holiday, but they did not mind opening a bottle of wine for us. The food we ordered‚Äîdeviled fish, kotthu, fish & chips & kankung‚Äîalso tasted very good. 

All in all, it was a great evening at Jo Jo and located Jo Jo‚Äôs bar/restaurant. It was also full, but the nice waiters brought a table and chairs for us to be very close to water.

Very recently I visited them at around 10.30 in the night for a take away. However their kitchen was about to close and they were not taking any more...orders. We were bit stuck and didn't want to go for another restaurant as we were tired. After having a chat we came outside and were about to leave the place. At that point the manager came to our car by himself and asked us to get down and come inside. He said thst they will take our order. I asked if we were giving them trouble but he said no let us take the order. And we did and were relieved since our time was saved by him. 

The way he handled our order was going for the extra mile. The way he ensured that whatever the order is without knowing that in advance, will be provided to us is fantastic. It may have given some extra trouble to his chefs but he made sure a customer is treated well beyond expected level and he did his best to retain us for the next time as well. 

I'm not sure the rest of the staff is well trained for being proactive but this gentleman is fantast orders. We were bit stuck and didn't want to go for another restaurant as we were tired.
