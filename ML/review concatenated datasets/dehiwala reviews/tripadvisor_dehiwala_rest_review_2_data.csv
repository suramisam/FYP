But don't just go for the cold brew... or to savour...your favourite spirits that you'd like to take with you. Go through their menu and you'll find quite a variety to sink your teeth into, or to satisfy your cravings for a nice and spicy 'bite'. If you're Sri Lankan, you know how important 'bites' are, and the immeasurable role it plays in complementing our drinking :-)... If you are one of those bite-people, Jo Jo's is the place on the beach... (I mean if you really know and love your bites).

It's not to say that their choice of mains (if I may call it so) are poor, they are a league of their own. We all know what a good Chinese-Sri Lankan style Chop Suey is... these guys have gone one step further and given it a more flavourful spin (at least that is what 'Z' (Z is one of the partners... who knows his food) told me one evening. I do agree that they've added a little magic of their own, to this ever-popular Chinese 'rice'. But that's not all. They've got more. 

The good thing is, when you give your order, tell one of the boya taking the order how you want your spice and they'll do the best with your request. The batter fried stuff are quite crunchy and they spicy stuff are just fiery in a kind of tantalising way. 

By the way, it doesn't mean Jo Jo's is only for the guys & gals who want to sip a brew or down a few shots. It's also a charming setting, to just go out for a chilled out dinner with someone close or your family.

JoJo‚Äôs is typical of these, pleasant enough but nothing to get excited about. All these places have identikit menus, the usual fish, chicken,...beef and squid dishes for around 700LKR. Some of them then ramp up the cost by charging up to 450 for a portion of steamed rice, all have sky-high beer prices (often not listed on the menu) and all add 10%, so the final bill can turn out a bit more than you were expecting.

At Jojo‚Äôs the food is OK, the generous portion of rice moderately priced and the beer as overpriced as everywhere else. In the evening they ruin the tranquil atmosphere, sound of waves, etc. by playing a local radio station at high volume so you get random music or, half the time, someone talking. Service was pretty quick when I was there, but I was the only diner ‚Äì there seems a general lack of punters in this area nowadays.

I wouldn‚Äôt particularly recommend eating on Lavinia Beach at all, but if you want to, JoJos is as good as the various more expensive places listed on TA. If you can't find somewhere quieter, it‚Äôs not a bad choice. If you can, the quality will likely be about the sam beef and squid dishes for around 700LKR.

The closest restaurant was packed and we walked few more meters...and located Jo Jo‚Äôs bar/restaurant. It was also full, but the nice waiters brought a table and chairs for us to be very close to water.

It was the full moon and the moonlit beach and festive atmosphere‚Äîfamilies frolicking in water and occasional fireworks flying over the ocean‚Äîmade it a very special evening. 
Humorously, they did not serve beer because full moon was a religious holiday, but they did not mind opening a bottle of wine for us. The food we ordered‚Äîdeviled fish, kotthu, fish & chips & kankung‚Äîalso tasted very good.
