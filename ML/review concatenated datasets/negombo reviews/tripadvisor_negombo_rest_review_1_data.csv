Our food was served in coconut shells which I personally did not like but it's a tourist attraction.
All was good until we received...our bill. We knew it would be pricey. The printout was in very faint ink so they write the total price in ink and ring it for you.
SCAM ALERT....
I used the flashlight on my phone to check the price and they had substituted 12,000 for 21,000 which we almost paid. When I realised, I complained and I was asked what the problem was. I told the waiter who just shrugged it off. The other waiters could see I was not happy and asked why. I told them and one of them even laughed. As soon as I mentioned TripAdvisor, the top man working was called. He said it was just a easy mistake and the barman was new. When I asked to see the manager he said it was not a problem and he was not working and we could have a free drink on the house. I declined and left and I want other customers to be made aware of this sc our bill. We knew it would be pricey.
