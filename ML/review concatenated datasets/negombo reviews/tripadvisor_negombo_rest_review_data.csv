So pleased we chose to eat there as it was the best meal of our entire 2 week tour of Sri Lanka and one I won't forget. 

I had the mutton curry and rotti which was absolutely delicious with the most incredible, rich curry gravy. My husband had the chicken skewers which were also delicious. Prior to this they provided us with some canapés on the house which were also very tasty. 

The staff could not have done more for us. We shared a bottle of wine (also very good) my glass was never empty and they were incredibly attentive. 

We then shared the crepes which were also delicious, though would add that its not a crepe as the French have, but more mini pancakes.

Staff is very friendly. The restaurant looks very new, clean and beautiful....Part of the profits go to 'the hope foundation' (helping streetdogs, cats and 58 dogs that live at the owners place because they wouldnt survive on the street), which is also an initiative from the owner of the restaurant.
