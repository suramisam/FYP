It's quite a basic restuarant but the food is superb and very affordable...on a European budget.

We picked our fish and ordered beers and sides to go with our food. Having walked past fresh okra in a small shop nearby we asked if they had any. They didn't but went out and bought some especially to accompany our food. Now that is service! Fish is cooked at the front of the restuarant on the grill, so you can watch if you want, while the rest is cooked in the restuarant. We went a bit crazy and ordered prawns, tuna and octopus. It was magnificent but too much for us to finish (but we did a good job) and the okra side was delicious. We washed our food down with beer and when they didn't have enough cold beers they made sure to cool some down.

Staff were excellent and the service professional and friendly. A really great me on a European budget.

The amount of fish and food for the price paid was also the best value we received.
As you can see from the pic we...had a huge Mahi-Mahi fish big enough for 2 people for 1,500rps (we had fish at other restaurants for 2 people that we paid more for and left feeling hungry) the fish here filled us up and really was big enough for 2.  We also had 15 prawns for 1,500rps. The food came with 2 plates of fries, a bowl of rice and 2 plates of salad, no extra charges or taxes. The seasoning of the fish and prawns was amazing and we were even asked if we wanted any extra rice or fries.
The restaurant is easy to find , if you walked out of food city turn left and walk along the main road without crossing,( you will see the coast guard on your right hand side as you walk). Eventually on your left hand side you will come to a Chinese restaurant , with a huge sign showing all of the difference hotel names , this is where you turn left and will find The Roti shop marissa( right next door to another fish restaurant called Mirissa inn). 
Down the beach you pay more for the views not because the fish is better. You will not be dissapointed if you go here , it's fun choosing your fish and it feels good knowing you are getting amazing value and not being ripped off as a tourist.
