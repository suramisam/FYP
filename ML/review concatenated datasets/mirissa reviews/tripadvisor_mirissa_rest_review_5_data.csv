High quality food; would recommend the pizza, burgers and brownie which had nuts and was served warm. Live music was great touch!

Chameera even noticed my friend drop her knife and replaced...it instantly even though she wasn't using it. And was always looking out if we wanted to order anything else. Thank y it instantly even though she wasn't using it. And was always looking out if we wanted to order anything else. Thank you!"

Were left disappointed. Chips were fine. Beer batter really good. Fish however didn't taste fresh. One piece we didn't eat due to how fishy it smelt. Lucky that one of...us ordered the crispy chicken burger as that was amazing. Would definitely return for that and also the awesome service from Chamee us ordered the crispy chicken burger as that was amazing. Would definitely return for that and also the awesome service from Chameera.
