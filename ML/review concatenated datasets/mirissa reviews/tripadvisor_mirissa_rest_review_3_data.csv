However, the staff spent all their time chasing customers off certain seats as they had to spend x amount to sit there. The rest of the time they were...just staring at people as if to wish they‚Äôd hurry up or buy more drinks. There was no chill whatsoever. Definitely not the relaxing hangout I‚Äôd anticipated. Didn‚Äôt even bother to stay and use the pool - decided I‚Äôd rather have another surfing lesson instead. Disappointi just staring at people as if to wish they‚Äôd hurry up or buy more drinks.

The location was nice - on the beach, watching people surf. However the food took such a long time to come, several of us had actual hunger pains waiting...for it. On top of this a chicken dish was delivered with seafood, a burger was served with a hair, and the portions were small. The burger that came ""with fries"" literally had four (4) small potato wedges. The prawns with ""mashed potato"" were practically a starter (see photo). Multiple people ordered a second meal to curb the hunger. Food tasted good but was definitely NOT worth the price or the hass for it. On top of this a chicken dish was delivered with seafood, a burger was served with a hair, and the portions were small.

Vegetarian burger was absolutely beautiful however my partner felt the beef burger was fairly average and small side portions with the burgers in comparison to other places. Would still recommend and go back there!
