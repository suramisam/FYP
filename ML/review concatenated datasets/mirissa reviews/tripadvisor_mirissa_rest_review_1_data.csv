The Manager was warm and welcoming on arrival and the Villa was clean and spacious. We were a family of four (2x teenagers) and had a family room...on the upper levels. The rooms are simple but nice, with A/C, fans and a nice balcony.
The location is perfect, right on the water, so slept to the sound of the surf.
Breakfast again was simple but great, with a Sri Lankan or continental option and had in front of the water.
There were quite a high number of mosquitoes as we were here in the monsoon season, but the rooms had great mosquito nets so all good.
Easy walk up the beach to other restaurants and main surf breaks.
Definitely recommend Palm Villas as a nice spot to relax at when in Miris on the upper levels. The rooms are simple but nice, with A/C, fans and a nice balcony.

We tried both the veggie burger (marred by punishingly hot sauce - not mentioned in the menu description), and their signature Suicide Burger, a giant stack of beef patties, bacon, and...fried egg and toppings.

The latter looks better than it tastes. The burgers are yummy, but the fried egg was way over cooked, denying any yolky goodness, and is a challenge to eat. It is merely that it is almost comically large, but the buns are too big for the meat, and fall apart, too easily.

Fries are well prepared.

Don’t veer away from burgers. Their pastas were uninspired, gummy and bland. 

Strawberry shakes are gre fried egg and toppings.
